Using a set of 64 characters, usually made up of letters, digits, and symbols, Base64 is a way of encoding data. When representing binary data as text, such as in email files or URLs, Base64 is frequently used.

As a result of their use of a compression algorithm that discards some image data in order to decrease the file size, JPGs are a lossy format. The bottom uses lossless. The bottom is a lossless image. Since this picture is in PNG format, the likelihood that it is lossless is higher. PNG pictures use a compression algorithm that keeps all of the original image data without losing any information, making them a lossless image format. PNG images use a different type of compression algorithm than JPEG images, which is intended to keep the data while still achieving a smaller file size. JPEG images are made to shrink the file size by discarding some of the data."
