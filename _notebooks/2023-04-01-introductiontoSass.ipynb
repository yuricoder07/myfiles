This means when you run Sass code, you're actually converting your code to CSS. That CSS code output is then used directly by a browser.\n",

    "# Nesting\n",

    "> #### While composing HTML, you might have observed that it exhibits an explicit nested and visual structure. However, CSS lacks such a hierarchy. On the contrary, Sass allows you to nest your CSS selectors in a manner that aligns with the visual hierarchy of your HTML. Nonetheless, excessive nesting may generate overly qualified CSS, which can be challenging to maintain and is usually considered undesirable.Keeping this in consideration, here's a sample of common styles for a website's navigation:\n",
