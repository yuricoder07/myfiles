## N@M was fun, I got to meet up with some of my friends in other classes to see their artworks, as well as meet with my CSP group to present our project. Below I will share some of the artoworks i've seen


# Ceramics

### I was entrigued by this work of art. Cyramics is hard, so looking at this octpus made me wonder how much efforts this person placed into making it. The amount of patience and persistance required to do this is high.
