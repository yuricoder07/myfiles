# My Quiz

## Programs purpose

For my code.org quiz, I wanted it to quiz based on US history. I made it so it had 3 questions. When creating the quiz, there were several parts. First I made a "correct" and "incorrect", and "start" screen. I also made the "quiz1" , "quiz2" , and "quiz3" screens that showed the questions. When the user starts the code, he is prompted with a start quiz button, once clicked he is directed to the quiz1 screen. If the answer is answerd correctly, the score will be logged +1 and the user will be redirected to the correct screen. If answerd incorrect, the score will be logged -1 and the user will be redirected to the incorrect screen. At the end the code brings up the "FinalScore" screen which shows the percent you got on the quiz.


## Data Abstraction

In the image below you can see how I logged the score throughout the code. I used the "settext" function to abstract the data stored in the "score" variable. The "settext" function took the data and placed it on a label on the "FinalScore" page.
