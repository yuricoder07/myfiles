title: Challenges faced completing AWS

# Sadly I was not able to complete the AWS hacks for this week, but I will show some of the ways I tried to resolve these issues.

#### The main issue when trying to complete the assignment was when running the command "sudo docker-compose up -d", here was the issue I was presented with:

#### Originally I had a parsing error which was caused by me placing the wrong code into the "docker compose yml file". The way I fixed this was by opening the flask repository in vscode, and manually copying and pasting the code there and pushing it.

#### Going back to the current issue, some ways I tried resolving was making sure my team's individual flask's were set up correctly meaning they were on different ports, and had the correct directory implemented in their docker compose yml file. I also reached out to Mr Yeung, who attempted to help me, but was not able to.
