# What is N@M?
### N@M or Night at the Museum, is a event hosted by Del Norte where you can view the art created by the different art classes for that trimester. This blog will show the different art works I found.

# AP art
### AP art is a very unique class, the different artworks displayed were very interesting. Some arts displayed immense realism, while some were just geometric designs. One artwork I ran across that peaked my interest is shown below.

# Computer Animation 1
### Last year when I was a freshman, I took this class. For the first trimester final you are supposed to create a digital created scene with a donut, water cup, table, chair and room with some sort of background. This class was very interesting seeing the different types of unique ways people designed their scenes. I chose one scene that I thought looked the best below.

# Ceramics
### I never took ceramics, but just by looking at it, it looks hard. When I was walking around the classroom I saw an octopus shaped object. This ceramic creation looked very hard to make so I thought it was interesting to add to my blog.
