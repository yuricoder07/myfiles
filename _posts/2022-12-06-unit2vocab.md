# Unit 2 Vocabulary


Term               | Definition     | Example      |
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Bits  | A bit (binary digit) is the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store |![](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/b/bit-byte.png)               |
Bytes  | a group of binary digits or bits (usually eight) operated on as a unit. | ![](https://techterms.com/img/lg/byte_21.png)                      |
Hexadecimal  | relating to or using a system of numerical notation that has 16 rather than 10 as its base | ![](https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hexadecimal-Number-System-Table.png)                   |
Nibbles  | a nibble is four consecutive binary digits or half of an 8-bit byte |                       |
Unsigned Integer  | Unsigned Integers (often called "uints") are just like integers (whole numbers) but have the property that they don't have a + or - sign associated with them |![](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wJwrZkuh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://scs.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer/Thumb.aspx%3FeventTargetPID%3Df02fb73c-8769-43de-a970-bda301209a04%26sessionPID%3D57b29532-2a7d-4dac-8168-8892127d9e49%26number%3D20%26isPrimary%3Dfalse%26absoluteTime%3D13076614406.5337)                       |
Signed Integer  | A signed integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes an integer in the range [-2147483648 to 2147483647]. |                    ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wJwrZkuh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://scs.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer/Thumb.aspx%3FeventTargetPID%3Df02fb73c-8769-43de-a970-bda301209a04%26sessionPID%3D57b29532-2a7d-4dac-8168-8892127d9e49%26number%3D20%26isPrimary%3Dfalse%26absoluteTime%3D13076614406.5337)|
Floating Point  | denoting a mode of representing numbers as two sequences of bits, one representing the digits in the number and the other an exponent which determines the position of the radix point. |![](https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/encyclopedia-terms/floating-point-numbers.fit_lim.size_1050x.gif)                       |
Boolean  | a binary variable, having two possible values called “true” and “false.” | ![](https://i0.wp.com/www.tutorialbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Python-Boolean-operators.png?fit=474%2C316&ssl=1)                      |
ASCII  | ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet. |![](https://jbwyatt.com/I/asciiGood.gif)                       |
Unicode  | an international encoding standard for use with different languages and scripts, by which each letter, digit, or symbol is assigned a unique numeric value that applies across different platforms and programs. |![](https://codescracker.com/computer-fundamental/images/character-map-window.JPG) |
RGB  | RGB (red, green, and blue) refers to a system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display.| ![](https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/RGB-color.gif) |
Lossy  | A compression scheme in which "useless" or less-than-totally-necessary information is thrown out in order to reduce the size of the data. |![](https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/encyclopedia-terms/lossless-compression-lossy.fit_lim.size_1050x.gif)                       |
Lossless  | a data compression algorithm that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data | ![](https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/encyclopedia-terms/lossless-compression-lossy.fit_lim.size_1050x.gif)
