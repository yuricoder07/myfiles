## Reflection

#### I got question #17 wrong. I Placed C as the answer. The question was "Which of the following code segments produce the same result as the statement above for all possible values of val1 and val2 ? Select two answers." The correct answers are A, and D. I made a mistake clicking only one solution.

#### I also got question 27 wrong. I chose answer B. I made a mistake in reading the question wrong, so I should read more thoroughly. If I read more thouroghly I would've been able to tell the correct answer. It was just asking which of the following code segments would move the arrow to the grey block

#### I got question #30 wrong. I chose A. Again I need to read the directions more thoroughly because it said to select 2 options, and I only selected one.

#### I got question 40 wrong. I chose answer C. This option is incorrect. The robot turns right one, two, or three times and could end up in a square to the left of its initial position. It cannot end up in a square above its initial position. Answer B is correct because, the robot turns to the right one, two, or three times and then moves one or two squares forward. The possible final locations are to the right, below, or to the left of the starting position.
