            "content": "Lists . What are lists? . Lists: a sequence of variables . we can use lists to store multiple items into one variable | used to store collections of data | changeable, ordered, allow duplicates | . List examples in Python, JavaScript, and Pseudocode. . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;grape&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;] print (fruits) . const fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;grape&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;]; . fruits ‚Üê [apple, grape, strawberry] . More list examples . brands = [&quot;nike&quot;, &quot;adidas&quot;, &quot;underarmour&quot;] #string numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] #integer truefalse = [True, False, True] #boolean . Lists are just one of four collection data types in Python . Tuple: collection that is ordered, unchangeable, allows duplicates | Set: collection that is unordered, unchangeable, doesn&#39;t allow duplicates | Dictionary: collection that is ordered, changeable, doesn&#39;t allow duplicates | . Terms . Index: a term used to sort data in order to reference to an element in a list (allows for duplicates) | Elements: the values in the list assigned to an index | . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;grape&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;] index = 1 print (fruits[index]) . Methods in Lists . Method Definition Example . append() | adds element to the end of the list | fruits.append(&quot;watermelon&quot;) | . index() | returns the index of the first element with the specified value | fruits.index(&quot;apple&quot;) | . insert() | adds element at given position | fruits.insert(1, &quot;watermelon&quot;) | . remove() | removes the first item with the specified value | fruits.remove(&quot;strawberry&quot;) | . reverse() | reverses the list order | fruits.reverse() | . sort() | sorts the list | fruits.sort() | . count() | returns the amount of elements with the specified value | fruits.count(&quot;apple&quot;) | . copy() | returns a copy of the list | fruits.copy() | . clear() | removes the elements from the list | fruits.clear() | . sports = [&quot;football&quot;, &quot;hockey&quot;, &quot;baseball&quot;, &quot;basketball&quot;] # change the value &quot;soccer&quot; to &quot;hockey&quot; print (sports) . [&#39;football&#39;, &#39;hockey&#39;, &#39;baseball&#39;, &#39;basketball&#39;] . sports = [&quot;football&quot;, &quot;soccer&quot;, &quot;golf&quot;, &quot;basketball&quot;] # add &quot;golf&quot; as the 3rd element in the list print (sports) . [&#39;football&#39;, &#39;soccer&#39;, &#39;golf&#39;, &#39;basketball&#39;] . Try this . Determine the output of the code segment | . &quot;Unusual&quot;, &quot;bold&quot; , &quot;away&quot; . Iteration . stuff . title:Iteration HW- toc: true | comments: true | categories: [iteration] | tags: [iteration] | . First, what not to do . Iteration is important for your time and sanity . print(&quot;alpha&quot;) print(&quot;bravo&quot;) print(&quot;charlie&quot;) print(&quot;delta&quot;) print(&quot;echo&quot;) print(&quot;foxtrot&quot;) print(&quot;golf&quot;) print(&quot;hotel&quot;) print(&quot;india&quot;) print(&quot;juliett&quot;) print(&quot;kilo&quot;) print(&quot;lima&quot;) print(&quot;mike&quot;) print(&quot;november&quot;) print(&quot;oscar&quot;) print(&quot;papa&quot;) print(&quot;quebec&quot;) print(&quot;romeo&quot;) print(&quot;sierra&quot;) print(&quot;tango&quot;) print(&quot;uniform&quot;) print(&quot;victor&quot;) print(&quot;whiskey&quot;) print(&quot;x-ray&quot;) print(&quot;yankee&quot;) print(&quot;zulu&quot;) #please help me . alpha bravo charlie delta echo foxtrot golf hotel india juliett kilo lima mike november oscar papa quebec romeo sierra tango uniform victor whiskey x-ray yankee zulu . Coding all of these individually takes a lot of unnecessary time, how can we shorten this time? . Iteration . Iteration is the repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. There&#39;s a lot of types of iteration though, what to use? How do we apply iteration to lists? . Some methods include using a &quot;for loop&quot;, using a &quot;for loop and range()&quot;, using a &quot;while loop&quot;, and using comprehension . Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable objects. They are the &#39;containers&#39; that store the data to iterate. . Each of these containers are able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration:definite and indefinite. Definite iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met . for variable in iterable: statement() . Iterator? Iterable? Iteration? . When an object is iterable it can be used in an iteration | When passed through the function iter() it returns an iterator | Strings, lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples are all examples of iterable objects. | . a = [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;bravo&#39;, &#39;charlie&#39;] itr = iter(a) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) . alpha bravo charlie . Loops . Well, above is basically just printing them again, so how do we takes these iterators into something we can make use for? | Loops take essentially what we did above and automates it, here are some examples. | . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # using a for loop for i in list: #for item in the list, print the item print(i) . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # Taking the length of the list lengthList = len(list) # Iteration using the amount of items in the list for i in range(lengthList): print(list[i]) . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # Once again, taking the length of the list lengthList = len(list) # Setting the variable we are going to use as 0 i=0 # Iteration using the while loop # Argument saying WHILE a certain variable is a certain condition, the code should run while i &lt; lengthList: print(list[i]) i += 1 . Using the range() function . But wait, there&#39;s more . Need to save even more time? The above is useful for many occasions, but can get tedious fast, in this case, use range() | . x = range(5) for n in x: print(n) . 0 1 2 3 4 . Else, elif, and break . For when 1 statement isn&#39;t enough . Else:when the condition does not meet, do statement()- Elif: when the condition does not meet, but meets another condition, do statement() | Break: stop the loop | . HW Iteration . Use the list below to turn the first letter of any word (using input()) into its respective NATO phonetic alphabet word . Ex: . list -&gt; . lima india sierra tango . words = [&quot;alfa&quot;, &quot;bravo&quot;, &quot;charlie&quot;, &quot;delta&quot;, &quot;echo&quot;, &quot;foxtrot&quot;, &quot;golf&quot;, &quot;hotel&quot;, &quot;india&quot;, &quot;juliett&quot;, &quot;kilo&quot;, &quot;lima&quot;, &quot;mike&quot;, &quot;november&quot;, &quot;oscar&quot;, &quot;papa&quot;, &quot;quebec&quot;, &quot;romeo&quot;, &quot;sierra&quot;, &quot;tango&quot;, &quot;uniform&quot;, &quot;victor&quot;, &quot;whiskey&quot;, &quot;xray&quot;, &quot;yankee&quot;, &quot;zulu&quot;] inp = input().lower() . 2D Iteration . 2D Arrays . A 2D array is simply just a list of lists. The example below is technically correct but... . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Conventially 2D arrays are written like below. This is because 2D arrays are meant to be read in 2 dimensions (hence the name). Writing them like below makes them easier to visualize and understand. . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Printing a 2D Array . We already know that we can&#39;t just print the matrix by calling it. We need to iterate through it to print it. . def print_matrix1(matrix): for i in range(len(matrix)): # outer for loop. This runs on i which represents the row. range(len(matrix)) is in order to iterate through the length of the matrix for j in range(len(matrix[i])): # inner for loop. This runs on the length of the i&#39;th row in the matrix (j changes for each row with a different length) print(matrix[i][j], end=&quot; &quot;) # [i][j] is the 2D location of that value in the matrix, kinda like a coordinate pair. [i] iterates to the specific row and [j] iterates to the specific value in the row. end=&quot; &quot; changes the end value to space, not a new line. print() # prints extra line. this is in the outer loop, not the inner loop, because it only wants to print a new line for each row . print(&quot;Raw matrix (list of lists): &quot;) print(keypad) print(&quot;Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration:&quot;) print_matrix1(keypad) print() . Raw matrix (list of lists): [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&#39; &#39;, 0, &#39; &#39;]] Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . def print_matrix2(matrix): for row in matrix: # Iterates through each &quot;row&quot; of matrix. Row is a dummy variable, it could technically be anything. It iterates through each value of matrix and each value is it&#39;s own list. in this syntax the list is stored in &quot;row&quot;. for col in row: # Iterates through each value in row. Again col, column, is a dummy variable. Each value in row is stored in col. print(col, end=&quot; &quot;) # Same as 1 print() # Same as 1 print_matrix2(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . More Functions . Try to find another way to print the matrix. Only complete one of the two (unless you&#39;d like to do both). Below is a hint . fruit = [&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;bananas&quot;, &quot;grapes&quot;] print(fruit) print(*fruit) # Python built in function: &quot;*&quot;. Figure out what it does . [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;bananas&#39;, &#39;grapes&#39;] apples bananas grapes . def print_matrix3(matrix): code = &quot;your code goes here&quot; . Alternatively, find a way to print the matrix using the iter() function you already learned. Or use both! . def print_matrix4(matrix): code = &quot;your code goes here&quot; . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] . Print what month you were born and how old you are by iterating through the keyboard (don&#39;t just write a string). . Challenge . Change all of the letters that you DIDN&#39;T print above to spaces, &quot; &quot;, and then print the full keyboard. (the things you did print should remain in the same spot) . Alternative Challenge: If you would prefer, animate it using some form of delay so it flashes one of your letters at a time on the board in order and repeats. (this one may be slightly more intuitive) . DO NOT HARD CODE THIS. Don&#39;t make it harder on yourself, iterate through, make it abstract so it can be used dynamically. You should be able to input any string and your code should work. . . 1 6 R A H C M . If you get stuck you can just make a picture with an array and print it (I will grade based on how good it looks) . I do expect an attempt so write some code to show you tried the challenge. .",

What is a boolean? . A data type with two possible values: true or false | . Boolean and Binary . So similar yet so different. . Boolean math and binary notation both use the same two ciphers: 1 and 0. | However, please note that Boolean quantities are restricted to a singlular bit (can only be either 1, or 0) | On the otherhand, binary numbers may be composed of many bits adding up in place-weighted form to any finite value, or size | . Must Knows . A Boolean value is either TRUE or FALSE | The AP Exam will provide you with a reference sheet with the operators below. | . A few ways these operators could be used... | . Relational Operators in action . How could you use operators to determine if the average of 5 grades is greater than 80? | . With the grades below, use a boolean expression to determine if the average grade is above an 80 and print the result (True or False) | Try it in as few steps as possible! | Be creative! There are obviously TONS of different practical solutions | . grade1 = 90 grade2 = 65 grade3 = 60 grade4 = 75 grade5 = 95 gradeAvg = (grade1+grade2+grade3+grade4+grade5)/5 print(gradeAvg &gt; 80) .

The versatility of relational operators: . print(&quot;100 == 100:&quot;,100==100) print(&quot;Hello == Adios:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;==&quot;farewell&quot;) print(&quot;Hello != Adios:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;!=&quot;farewell&quot;) print(&quot;Hello == Hola:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;==&quot;greeting&quot;) print(&quot;5&gt;=4:&quot;, 5&gt;=4) print (&#39;&#39;) # Notice that relational operators can even work on lists! # For lists, the relational operator compares each respective component until an answer is derived print(&quot;[&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]:&quot;, [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]) . 100 == 100: True Hello == Adios: False Hello != Adios: True Hello == Hola: True 5&gt;=4: True [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]: False [1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]: True [1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]: False [1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]: False . Logical Operators! . These types of operators don&#39;t necessarily deal with equivalent/non-equivalent values, but they rather work on operands to produce a singular boolean result . AND : returns TRUE if the operands around it are TRUE | OR : returns TRUE if at least one operand is TRUE | NOT : returns TRUE if the following boolean is FALSE | . Turn the following arithmetic phrases into either True or False statements as indicated USING LOGICAL OPERATORS . print(&quot;1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12:&quot;, 1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12) # Output TRUE using OR ^ # Output FALSE using NOT print(&quot;24 &gt; 8:&quot;,24 &gt; 8) # Output FALSE using AND print(&quot;10 &gt; 20:&quot;, 10 &gt; 20 and False) . 1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12: True 24 &gt; 8: True 10 &gt; 20: False . Lesson Overview: 3.6 - Conditionals . Focusing on Selection . Selection: uses a condition that evaluates to true or false . Selection determines which part of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false . Algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task . Conditional Statements . Also known as &quot;if statements&quot; . Can be seen as if statements or if blocks . Can also be seen as if else statements or if else-blocks . x = 20 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) . x is greater than y . x = 9 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is not greater than y&quot;) . x is not greater than y .

Lesson Overview - 3.7 Nested Conditionals . Nested conditional statements consist of conditional statements within other conditional statements | Utilizes &quot;if else&quot; statements within &quot;if else&quot; statements | . Basics of a nested conditional: | . Block Coding Visual of Nested Conditionals: . | Example Psuedocode of Nested Conditional Statements . | . Analyzing Code Walkthrough .

Restaurants are recommended based on whether they can accommodate all allergies and dietary restrictions, not based on whether group members have been there before. Information about which food allergies and dietary restrictions can be accommodated at nearby restaurants is needed so that a restaurant can be recommended for the group. . Question 28 . This code segment incorrectly charges customers who use more than 25 units of electricity. These customers are charged $7 per unit for all units, when they should be charged this rate only for the number of units above 25. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 ‚Äì 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. This code segment would incorrectly charge the customer $224 for the 32 units. . Question 35 . The last line in this code segment sets maxPS to 50 regardless of the value of time. . Question 42 . After initially assigning values to the variables, the code segment assigns the value 4 to num3 and assigns the value 8 to num1. The value of sum at the end of the code segment is 8 + 4 + 4, or 16. . Question 43 . This is the value of x after the code segment is executed, not the value of result. . Question 47 . The eighth statement assigns the value of c + d / 2 (which is 50) to d. . Question 50 . This statement concatenates firstName and lastName and then assigns the first character of the result (which is the first character of firstName) to initials. .",

Some arts displayed immense realism, while some were just geometric designs. One artwork I ran across that peaked my interest is shown below. . . Computer Animation 1 . Last year when I was a freshman, I took this class. For the first trimester final you are supposed to create a digital created scene with a donut, water cup, table, chair and room with some sort of background. This class was very interesting seeing the different types of unique ways people designed their scenes. I chose one scene that I thought looked the best below. . . Ceramics . I never took ceramics, but just by looking at it, it looks hard. When I was walking around the classroom I saw an octopus shaped object. This ceramic creation looked very hard to make so I thought it was interesting to add to my blog. . .",

The main issue when trying to complete the assignment was when running the command ‚Äúsudo docker-compose up -d‚Äù, here was the issue I was presented with: . . Originally I had a parsing error which was caused by me placing the wrong code into the ‚Äúdocker compose yml file‚Äù. The way I fixed this was by opening the flask repository in vscode, and manually copying and pasting the code there and pushing it. . . Going back to the current issue, some ways I tried resolving was making sure my team‚Äôs individual flask‚Äôs were set up correctly meaning they were on different ports, and had the correct directory implemented in their docker compose yml file. I also reached out to Mr Yeung, who attempted to help me, but was not able to. .",

Personal Takeways . Watching these videos definitely opened my mind to how crucial collaboration is, especially in a field like computer science. I hope that from now on, my team and I will be able to communicate with each other and help each other no matter the circumstances. . 1.2: Daily Video 1 . Computing Innovations . Innovations can include, but are not limited to: . Applications Games | Social Media | Business | Productivity | . | Physical Devices Computers | Smart Phones/tablets | Smart ‚ÄúThings‚Äù | Wearables | . | Systems E-commerce | Cloud services | E-mail | . | . Innovations Created for a Purpose . Guiding Questions: . Why does the computing innovation exist? | What problem(s) does the computing innovation solve? | What does the computing innovation allow us to do that we could not do before? | Examples of Computing Innovations . Social Media Applications Allows users to connect from a distance and archive their activites | . | E-commerce Allows users to save time and money by being able to shop from home | . | Digital Assistant Device Allows users to control their devices hands-free making them safer while driving or more convenient when trying to multitask | . | . Daily Video 1: Takeaways . The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interest through creative expression | An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovations provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation | . 1.2: Daily Video 2 . Identifying Inputs to Programs . Computer Programs accept input in a variety of different forms: . tactile (touch) | audio | visual | text (including numerical values) | . Examples: . Smart phone/tablet (texting, entering password, etc.) | Laptop computer (keyboard, mouse, etc.) | Gaming console (send input through buttons) | . How do programs receive input? . Most programs are written in an event driven environment. . ‚ÄúEvents‚Äù are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program | . Types of events a user can trigger: . mouse clicks | screen taps/swipes (force touch) | . What does input accomplish in a program? . Input usually affects the output. Outputs produced by a device can include: . visual | audio | tactile (touch/feel) | text | . Example of output that devices supply: . Smart phone/tablet (things that appear on screen based on what you have pressed/swiped) | Laptop computer (displays texts after using keyboard) | Gaming console (remote vibrations) | . How does a program know what to do upon an event? . An action triggers an event: . Action may be activated by the user or another program/device | . The program ‚Äújumps‚Äù to the code segment according to the event: . The code segment is ran | Output is triggered by the code segment/additional events that are triggered | . The program does not necessarily execute ‚Äúin order‚Äù: . Code segments are executed as they are called, according to the events triggered | . Daily Video 2: Takeaways . Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text | An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program | Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution | Inputs USUALLY affect the output produced by a program | Program output is usually based on a program‚Äôs input or prior state | . 1.2: Daily Video 3 . What is a program? . A program is a collection of statements: . A statement is a single command | A group of statements is called a code segment | A program is often referred to as ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù | Code segments are executed by rules of the coding language | . What does the program shown in the video do? - written to find the minimum value in a list . The code segment should work for a variety of different lists, such as numbers that are out of order, negative numbers, large numbers, and decimals | . Description . Simply state what the segment does this way, someone else can use the segment in a larger program | . | Include how it does what it does this way, someone could expand upon the code segment | . | . Daily Video 3: Takeaways . A program is a collection of program statements that performs a task when run by a computer | A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program | A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations | . Personal Takeways . After watching all three videos, I feel that I truly understand why knowing the purpose and function of a program is essential. Knowing exactly what your program is intended to do could allow someone who is reading it to use it in a larger program or even expand upon it. Overall, having knowledge about this big idea will definitely be helpful and I will apply this idea to anything that I do in this class. . 1.3: Daily Video 1 . How is a program developed? . It all starts with an idea. . Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan | At times, the development is more exploratory than anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad) | . Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect . Investigation is an important step in the process | Developers must: determine the requirements of the program | understand the constraints | understand the user concerns and interests | . | How do developers investigate? surveys | user testing | interviews | direct observations | . | . After initial investigation and reflection‚Ä¶ . Developers design the program by brainstorming (draw on investigation) | storyboarding the program | planning user experience | laying out the user interface | organizing into modules | develop a testing strategy | . | Developers decide on the program requirements that‚Ä¶ describe how a program should behave | include a list of user interactions | . | The program specifications outline all of the requirements | Developers create a prototype of the program (or components): a gradual process is frequently used so that developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program | . | . Testing, testing, and more testing! . Developers test the program every step of the way | Testing occurs at the micro level | macro level | . | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection | . Daily Video 1 Personal Takeaways . After watching the first daily video of 1.3, I now realize that if I want to have my idea for the final project behave like it is supposed to that numerous trials of the program will have to be run. This way, we can all see what parts of the program should be kept as is and which parts need to be modified to ensure optimal user experience. . 1.3: Daily Video 2 . How is a program developed? . Program development is seldom a solo endeavor . Typically, programs are developed by teams of people | Individuals/teams work on different functional components | Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work | Their names must be written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project | . While documentation is an important place to give credit‚Ä¶ . Many projects use comments within the programming language to give credit | This is an important part of the development of the program | When developers find a bug/error in a program, they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem | This may be most useful after a program is completed, and users find additional bugs | . Many times developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms, and more that are written by others. . These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited | Similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article | Any code segments, procedures, or algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author | The program documentation should include the author‚Äôs name and the source of any code segments being used | This portion of the documentation may resemble a bibliography or a works cited pages in a research paper | . Daily Video 2 Personal Takeways . I now know that any time I use code segments or algorithms, whether they are from my teammates or outside sources, I should always in some way give credit to the original author of that part of the program. This is because any code segments, procedures, or algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author. . 1.3: Daily Video 3 . How is a program developed? . Programmers create something called program documentation in order to‚Ä¶ . describe the overall program | list program specifications | describe‚Ä¶ functions/procedures/methods within the code | specific code segments | list of events and corresponding outputs | the development of the program | how other programs may interact with the program | . | list of contributors/authors of the program | . When does documentation happen? . Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: . At the beginning: list specifications | During: to keep track of proceess | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throughout can improve: | efficiency of overall programming process | programmers‚Äô ability to test and refine the program | programmers‚Äô response to bugs | . How do programmers document while programming? . Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not. . Commenting allows programmers to write text within the prgoram | This text does not affect the program | Comments are for programmers to read | This is a form of documentation and can be very usefil when programmers collaborate or work individually | . Daily Video 3 Personal Takeways . After watching this video, I now understand why it is important to include comments in code, as it allows one to understand what something does and how it was developed. . Collaberation Quiz (MCQ): . . Program Function and Development Quiz (MCQ): . . Program Design and Development Quiz (MCQ): . . Questions: .

            "content": "Idea 1 . Performance Task/Program Purpose and Function . For my APCSP project, I want to make an program that requests from blockchain APIs, and find if a transaction has confirmed towards a certain bitcoin address . The user will be able to input a bitcoin address or a TXID(transaction hash) into the program for the results. . Data Abstraction . In this program the data requested by the API‚Äôs will be stored in a dictionary. The program will access the data in the lists and dictionaries, and run them through functions that check if the transaction confirmed or is unconfirmed. The program will also store data about the transaction like fees, and dates on when the transaction was initiated. . Managing Complexity . This is still being thought out, but the main idea is to ideitify information based on a transation using the blockchain. It will output data like the transaction fees, and how long it takes or took the transaction to confirm on the blockchain. . Procedural Abstraction . The procedure for this program is to first take a TXID input by the user, then to request from blockchain APIs about the transaction. The API responses are then saved in a dictionary that are extracted and formated for the user to interpret. . Algorithm Implementation . The algorithm implementation would have to do with parsing/iterating the data saved in the dictionary. My program would need to assosiate variables with certain data. The Algorithm would need to loop through the data to output the right information the user. . Testing . For the testing, I will demonstrate how to use the program through a short video. I will also include a written documentation that explains how the program works as well as how to use it. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a ‚Äúlevel 1 heading‚Äù in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
