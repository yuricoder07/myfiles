Some of the big ideas and vocab that you observe, talk about it with a partner ... . &quot;Data compression is the reduction of the number of bits needed to represent data&quot; | &quot;Data compression is used to save transmission time and storage space.&quot; | &quot;lossy data can reduce data but the original data is not recovered&quot; | &quot;lossless data lets you restore and recover&quot; | . The Image Lab Project contains a plethora of College Board Unit 2 data concepts. Working with Images provides many opportunities for compression and analyzing size. . Image Files and Size . Here are some Images Files. Download these files, load them into images directory under _notebooks in your Blog. - Clouds Impression . Lassen Volcano | Green Square | . Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files. Describe how these relate to Data Compression ... . File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab | Size, height and width, number of pixels | Visual perception, lossy compression | . Python Libraries and Concepts used for Jupyter and Files/Directories . Introduction to displaying images in Jupyter notebook . IPython . Support visualization of data in Jupyter notebooks. Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML. . pathlib . File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux. This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS&#39;s), pathlib is a solution to this problem. . What are commands you use in terminal to access files? | What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? | What are some of the major differences? | . Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code. . Why is path a big deal when working with images? | How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? | Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? | . from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) # Run this as standalone tester to see sample data printed in Jupyter terminal if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # print parameter supplied image green_square = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}]) image_display(green_square) # display default images from image_data() default_images = image_data() image_display(default_images) . Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. | . numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? | From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? | How do these effects apply to images? | . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images.

This is probably due to a lack of experience working with persons who have darker skin tones. . 5.4 Summary . Not made intentionally, Because it was created using only data from white people, it can only identify white faces. If everyone had access to computers, issues like this may not arise as frequently, which is another argument for closing the digital divide.

            "content": "Overview . For our group CPT project, we are doing a recipe suggester. We called our project reciPies. My share for the project is to create a favoriting system where a user who is logged in can favorite a recipe. This will allow them to see it again if they ever wanted to. . Purpose and Function . Purpose: allows a user who is logged in to favorite recipes they like so they can come back. . ​Function: There will be a frontend that allows a user to click a grey star. Once the star is clicked, the start will turn gold. When the user clicks the star it will save in a database linking to the logged on users account, that will have a table of saved recipes. . Data Abstraction . When the JSON data for all the saved recipes is parsed, then a list called userfavorites, will record all of the favorited recipes. This will recorded on a frontend table on the website. . Managing Complexity . Using a list called userfavorites it allows managing complexity because it allows the program to easily access the user favorites and append to a frontend table. . Procedural Abstraction . A procedure, called addFavorite(), would allow a user to add a favorite, appending it into the JSON list. I can also have a procedure called accessStorage() allowing it to access the data stored in the JSON file, and converting it to a format that I can use to code. . Algorithm Implementation . Sequencing will be used in order to sort the most recently added favorite recipe to the oldest recipe on the bottom. This is important because users can get a sense of time of how long ago they favorited the recipe. . Testing . My two tests would be with a review of the favorited recipes in the JSON list: . Test to see if when clicked the favorited recipe is added to the JSON list | Test the accessStorage() function to see if I’m able to access the stored favorited data. | Video Plan . I will show the input(clicking the button), reload the page and show how it saves. I will then go on the backend showing the JSON db with the stored feilds. After that I will go to the table page (frontend) which shows all the stored favorited recipes. .",

Hacks . The Big Picture purpose of this hack is to build a database. Being able to create an SQLite table and populate test data within it is the major goal. To do this effectively it is imperative to show the following. . Build Schema for a table, make a new model file and use users.py as an example. Start slow and simple and build up. | Build an initXXXXX() method and use it to add preliminary/test data to the table. Once again use users.py as an example. | Make a 30-60 second video where you show a Debugging session of making new rows in the table. Use sqlite marketplace tools and/or sqlite3 command line tool to show success in creating table and adding data. | Hack Helper . Here are some tips. . Become familiar with initUsers(). Observe it is called/activated from main.py. This function activates after you run the main.py and activate the web application in the browser. Observe that the sqlite.db file will appear in the volumes directory in conjunction with home screen of site appearing in browser. . | Delete sqlite.db from volumes directory on your development machine. Set breakpoint on initUsers() and run main.py using debug. Use the step into option on the debugger and observe the creation of data. . | . @app.before_first_request def activate_job():initJokes() initUsers() . Make your own XXXXX.py file under model directory. Follow users.py and develop your own schema from the OOP code you did in last Hacks. Follow the pattern in users.py to make a initXXXX() function top populate some test data. . | In main.py, add your initXXXX() method to def activate_job() function shown above. Use this as basis of your video debugging session. Debugging is hugely important at this level to understand your database success prior to building an API. Building initXXXX() method, adding database records, and debugging will enable you to verify CRUD operations as you develop. . | .",

Set up your notebook by either wgetting the lesson or tracking it by your own (We would recommend wgetting since there are some fill in the blanks!) | wget here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmaxwu/Tri2-GroupFastpages/master/_notebooks/2022-12-dd-lesson.ipynb | . 3.17: Algorithm Efficiency . Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to help students understand how to make an efficient program and optimize it and understand its importance to the CSP curriculum. . What is Algorithmic Efficiency? . The ability of an algorithm to solve a problem in an efficient way An efficient algorithm solves a problem quickly and with a minimum amount of resources, such as time and memory. | . | How do we determine if an algorithm is efficient or not? One way we can do this is by determining the time complexity of the algorithm. | Another way is through space complexity. | . | . Traveling Merchant Problem Hacks: . What did you and your team discuss? (record below) .

Describe the method used to solve the traveling merchant problem. (record below) . To solve this traveling merchant problem, traveling in a circle through the different cities that are closes to each other. This method seems like its the best. | . 3.18: Undecidable Problems . Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important. . Key vocabulary: . Decision problem | Decidable problem | Undecidable problem | . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A decidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An undecidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. . Example of a Decidable Problem . The procedure below tests to see if a number is divisible by 13. If it is, it returns true. If it isn&#39;t, it returns false. . def divideThirteen(number): if number % 13 == 0: return True else: return False print(divideThirteen(26)) print(divideThirteen(30)) . True False . Undecidable Problems . An Example of a Forever Running Code . The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory). However, there is no end to this code, making the computer run forever. There is no halt to the code. . i = 0 number = 1 def integerTest(n): # Testing if the number is an integer if n%1 ==0: return True else: return False # Using while loop to keep searching an a non-integer above 1. Note that the computer runs forever. while i == 0: number += 1 if integerTest(number) == False: i +=1 print(&quot;Done&quot;) . The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an undecidable problem. It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. . There is no way to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not. . Halting Problem Example: . In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let&#39;s call this algorithm HaltChecker. | HaltChecker analyzes the program,program P, and its input,input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;halts&quot;. If program P doesn&#39;t halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the code runs forever, so HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. | Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker&#39;s output. So, if &quot;never&quot; is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is &quot;halts&quot;. It&#39;s also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of &quot;halts&quot;, then Reverser has an output of &quot;never&quot;. | We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code. | Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints &quot;never&quot; when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints &quot;halts&quot; when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem. | . This Diagram Sums up the Entire Process in the Bulleted List: . Credits of diagram and example to Khan Academy . FAQ . Q: If Reverser is causing the problem, why not remove it? | A: Removing Reverser will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate. | . Extra Things to Notice . Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever. | Humans are able to solve some undecidable problems. The entire Halting Problem example was to prove that computers cannot solve undecidable problems. | . Hacks . Come up with one situation in which a computer runs into an undecidable problem. Explain why it is considered an undecidable problem. . An example of a undecidable problem in a computer could be when a computer is trying to determine if a program will run forever or if it would eventually stop.This is known as the halting problem, and it is considered undecidable because there is no algorithmic way to determine whether a program will halt or not. This is because it is possible for a program to be written in such a way that it can check its own execution and determine whether it will halt or not, but this would require the program to be able to solve the halting problem itself, which is impossible. Therefore, the halting problem is considered undecidable. | . 3.17 Homework . Your homework for Algorithmic Efficiency is pretty simple. .

Open a terminal in vscode, run command: cd _notebooks, type &#39;wget&#39; and paste this link into said terminal and run it . | Take notes wherever you please, but you will be graded on participating . | . So, what is a simulation anyway? . A simulation is a tested scenario used for viewing results/outputs to prepare for them in real world situations . | These can be used for games like dice rolling, spinners, etc . | These can be used for practical things such as building structures, testing car crashes, and other things before engaging in them in the real world . | These simulations can have the option of obeying real world physics (Gravity, collision) or they can go against these norms since this is a fictitious scenario, and couldn&#39;t happen in real life . | . Big Question . Which of the following simulations could be the LEAST useful? . | A retailer trying to identify which products sold the most . | A restaurant determining the efficiency of robots | An insurance company studying the rain impact of cars | A sports bike company studying design changes to their new bike design | . If you guessed a bike company, you&#39;re wrong, because the retail simulation was the right answer. Simulating robots in food service, sudying rain impact on vehicles, and new bike design can contribute a lot more to society in comparison to seeing what products sell more than others. | . Next Big Question . If you were making a simulation for making a new train station, which of the following would be true about this simulation? . It could reveal potential problems/safety issues before construction starts | It cannot be used to test the train station in different weather | Simulation will add high costs to projects | Simulation is not needed because this train station already exists | . Potential Saftey was the right answer, because you need somewhere to test the safety and ethicness of what you&#39;re about to do before you start building it. Otherwise, let&#39;s just say you&#39;ll have a special plaque for FBI&#39;s Most Wanted | . Simulation 1: . Both programs below do the same thing. Given a height and a weight, they calculate how long it will take for a object to fall to the ground in a vacuum subjected to normal Earth levels of gravity. . However, the second one is a simulation. It calculates the distance the object has fallen every 0.1 seconds. This is useful for if you wanted a visual representation of a falling object, which pure math can&#39;t do as smoothly. . height = float(input(&quot;height in meters?&quot;)) weight = input(&quot;weight in pounds?&quot;) stuff = (2 * (height / 9.8))**(1/2) print(&quot;It will take&quot;, stuff,&quot;seconds for an object that weighs&quot;,weight,&quot;pounds&quot;,&quot;to fall &quot;,height,&quot;meters in a vacuum&quot;) . It will take 0.6388765649999398 seconds for an object that weighs 130 pounds to fall 2.0 meters in a vacuum . t = 0 g = 0 d = 0 false = True while false: t = t + 0.1 d = 9.8 / 2 * (t**2) if d &gt;= height: false = False #print(d) # if you want to print the distance every time it calculates it.

This simulation is made in order to simulate movement on a 2d plane vs a 3d plane. . | How it works: we have multiple variables, if statements and equations under a while command in order to randomy generate steps on a 2d plane. Once it reaches the set destination, it will say that the man made it home after x amount of steps. . | For the 3D plane, it takes a lot longer due to how big and open the 3d environment is, so there are more if statements in the 3d plane . | .

Simulations in the wild . Simulations are used extremely frequently in real life applications. One of the most common examples of simulations are video games. A games physics engine can accurately simulate objects colliding . Another example is Blender, the software used in 3d animations class, here at Del Norte. Blender is made up of many small simulations, but one big one it uses is simulating the way light bounces off of and interacts with objects. . HW !!! . Create a simulation. It can be anything, just has to simulate something. . Some ideas: . Two objects colliding | Gravity on other planets | . AND . Find an example of a simulation in a software/game you use, screenshot, and explain how it is a simulation . def populationSim(totalPopulation, dailyGrowthRate, goal): # default parameters yearCount = 0 dayCount = 0 print(&quot;control c to exit simulation&quot;) while totalPopulation &lt;

A library is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations. | These precompiled codes can be referred to as modules. Each module contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. | A library may also contain documentation, configuration data, message templates, classes, and values, etc. | . Why are libraries important? . Using Libraries makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. | One example would be through looping and iteration, as we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. | Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc. | . A few libraries that simplify coding processes: . Pillow allows you to work with images. | Tensor Flow helps with data automation and monitors performance. | Matplotlib allows you to make 2D graphs and plots. | . The AP Exam Refrence Sheet itself is a library! . Hacks: . Research two other Python Libraries NOT DISCUSSED DURING LESSON and make a markdown post, explaining their function and how it helps programmers code. . hashlib, pygame | . API&#8217;s . An Application Program Interface, or API, contains specific direction for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. | An API acts as a gateway for the imported procedures from a library to interact with the rest of your code. | . Activity: Walkthrough with NumPy . Install NumPy on VSCode: Open New Terminal In VSCode: | pip3 install --upgrade pip | pip install numpy | | . REMEMBER: When running library code cells use Python Interpreter Conda (Version 3.9.12) . Example of using NumPy for arrays: . import numpy as np new_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]) print (new_matrix) . [[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9]] . Example of using NumPy for derivatives: . import numpy as np # defining polynomial function var = np.poly1d([2, 0, 1]) print(&quot;Polynomial function, f(x): n&quot;, var) # calculating the derivative derivative = var.deriv() print(&quot;Derivative, f(x)&#39;=&quot;, derivative) # calculates the derivative of after # given value of x # print(&quot;When x=5 f(x)&#39;=&quot;, derivative(5)) . Polynomial function, f(x): 2 2 x + 1 Derivative, f(x)&#39;= 4 x When x=5 f(x)&#39;= 20 . Random Values . Random number generation (RNG) produces a random number (crazy right?) This means that a procedure with RNG can return different values even if the parameters (inputs) do not change | . | CollegeBoard uses RANDOM(A, B), to return an integer between integers A and B. RANDOM(1, 10) can output 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 | In Python, this would be random.randint(A, B), after importing Python&#39;s &quot;random&quot; library (import random) | JavaScript&#39;s works a little differently, with Math.random() returning a value between 0 and 1. To match Python and CollegeBoard, you could make a procedure like this | . | . | . CollegeBoard Example: What is the possible range of values for answ3 . Convert the following procedure to Python, then determine the range of outputs if n = 5. . PROCEDURE Dice(n) sum ← 0 REPEAT UNTIL n = 0 sum ← sum + RANDOM(1, 6) n ← n - 1 RETURN sum . import random # Fill in the blank def Dice(n): sum = 0 while(n!=0): sum = sum + random.randint(1,6) n = n-1 return(sum) Dice(5) # Will output a range of __ to __ . 21 . Homework . Write a procedure that generates n random numbers, then sorts those numbers into lists of even and odd numbers (JS or Python, Python will be easier). . | Using NumPy and only coding in python cell, find the answer to the following questions: a. What is the derivative of 2x^5 - 6x^2 + 24x? b. What is the derivative of (13x^4 + 4x^2) / 2 when x = 9? . | Suppose you have a group of 10 dogs and 10 cats, and you want to create a random order for them. Show how random number generation could be used to create this random order. . | import random def genSort(n): tempList = [] evenList = [] oddList = [] # loops and adds all the randomly generated numbers into temp list for i in range(n): nums = random.randint(1,30) tempList.append(nums) # loops through the length of templist, and checks if the number position is even or odd and appends accordingly for j in range(len(tempList)): # Even if tempList[j]%2 == 0: evenList.append(tempList[j]) continue # Odd else: oddList.append(tempList[j]) continue # prints odd list and even list print(str(tempList) + &quot; List of Generated Nums&quot;) print(str(evenList) + &quot; List of Sorted Evens&quot;) print(str(oddList)+ &quot; List of Sorted Odds&quot;) genSort(random.randint(1,10)) .

The lesson will start off with introducing what algorithms are and what they do, moreover, what their significance is. . 3.9 Lesson 1 has the objective to teach the student of the outcome of similar algorithmic concepts and similar algorithms. In this lesson, you will see different ways on how algorithms are developed. . Lesson 1 | Defining Algorithms . What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed through CODE. There are set limitations, this is what makes algorithms fun, you can your imagination and create whatever you wan with your own instructions! . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks . | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results. . | Some conditional statements can be written as the same as Boolean expressions (VICE VERSA) . | Different algorithms can be developed or use to solve the same problem. . | . Example 1 | What happens if we test the algorithm with different outputs? . The pseudocode above is translated to python for you. . Record what your outputs are when you enter 95 degrees F, does the algorithm yield the same result? . The conditional below is nested . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then 95, what do you notice? . It&#39;s too hot outside! . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then Input 95, what do you notice? . It&#39;s too hot outside! Sure I will play outside! . NOW RECORD with another output . Record what your outputs are when you enter 54, does the algorithm yield the same result this time? . *Now use 95 as an input for the two code blocks above. . Even though an algorithm&#39;s code can look the same, you have to be careful, they can always yield different results. When constructing algorithms you want to make sure that your code corresponds with what you want as your output. You set the limit of your code and you decide what the code&#39;s output is. . Conditionals vs. Booleans . The condition and instructions are what differ, that&#39;s where the magic happens. The condition is a boolean expression when an expression outputs either true or false. Boolean values are another type of data type in programming languages, and they can only ever hold true or false. . Exercise . Learning how to utilize conditionals and booleans are important for developing algorithms. Use this exercise to help you. . Can either Boolean expression on the right replace the conditional on the left? Assume isWeekday and isHoliday are Boolean variables. . *NOTE = you can edit the variables to check the conditions needed! . IsHoliday = False IsWeekday = True if IsHoliday: driveWork = True else: if IsWeekday: driveWork = True else: driveWork = False print(driveWork) . Logically thinking about conditionals and booleans . Now the problem may seem confusing, but the best way to develop an algorithm is to think about all the possible results that can be potentially be outputted. . So if IsHoliday is set to true, then driveWork is automatically equal to false and it does not matter what value of isWeekday is. This must mean that one of the conditionals must be NOT IsHoliday. . In the case that lets say IsHoliday is set to false, then the variable for weekday needs to be checked. If it&#39;s true then driveWork is true, if it&#39;s false then driveWork is false. This must mean that the other conditional isWeekday. . Combining both conditionals, you get option 2, which is not IsHoliday and IsWeekday. This is why option 2 is right! . Example 3 | Conditionals vs Booleans . The following algorithms are intended to sum the odd numbers from 1-9. Which algorithms work as intended? . Below, I have translated the block code into python, import this to your jupyter notebook and record the result. What do you notice? . First block . sum = 1 counter = 3 #iteration var = 0 while (var &lt; 4): #while the var is &lt;= 4, it executes those commands, once it exceeds it hits the else command sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 var = var + 1 # now go through the whole thing 4 times, this is an iteration, a vital part of algorithms. else: print(sum) . 25 . Second block . sum = 0 counter = 9 #iteration while (counter &gt;= 1): sum = sum + counter counter = counter - 2 print(sum) . 25 . When we start our initializing left sum as 1 counter as 3 we had no iterations yet. Remember we&#39;re going to have to repeat this four times because the block code prompts us to repeat 4 times, so we iterate. So as we go through and follow what the block gives us. . So you see that the sum does work, it does sum up the odd numbers from 1-9 . Now lets look at the right block. . Sum is set to 0 Counter is set to 9 We must repeat until the counter &lt; 1 is true. . So we keep adding until -1, that is when the counter &lt; 1 is true, so we stop . So why is it important to understand that algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same task? . An algorithm is beautiful that way, just because you think of solving a problem differently, doesn&#39;t mean your wrong, . 3.9 Part 2 . Flowcharts . Flowcharts can help you visualize the functionality of an algorithm . | They are a good way to double check whether or not your algorithm is achieving its purpose . | . How To Set Up A Flowchart . label the start point . | Define any and all variables you may need . | Consider the first question you want the algorithm to ask . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is yes (or true) . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is no (or false) . Steps 3-5 are the steps to creating code that uses a process called selection (you can convert the question from step 3 to a conditional if-statement in code) | . | Write out all necessary steps for the algorithm to function properly . | You may want your algorithm to iterate some steps until a condition is met . You can write the steps that need to be repeated, then draw an arrow from the last step to a step above that contains a conditional statement | . | determine a way to reach the end goal | Selection vs. Iteration . Selection: . A process used in algorithms where a conditional if-statement leads to one of two outcomes . Outcome 1: if the conditional statement is true, something will happen . | Outcome 2: if the conditional statement is false, something else will happen . | Ex: see Example A . | . | . | Iteration . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied . Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced . | This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement . | . | . | . Example A . Consider this situation: . You are shopping for your favorite food at your favorite supermarket . | You see that there is a sale on wheat products for 35% off . | There is another sale on produce for 20% off . | These sales are mutually exclusive . | Tax on all items is 8% . | . | Your TASK: . Create a flowchart for an algorithm that can be used to calculate the cost of your favorite item | . | . Example A Possible Solution (using Selection) . 3.9 Part 3 . For Algorithms How to combine and/or modify an existing algorithm. | . | . Benefits of combining algorithms can reduce development time, testing time, and simplify the identification of errors. | . | . Example in Class . Rules . step/rule 1: start with any positive integer | step/rule 2: if the preceding term is even; divide by 2 | step/rule 3: if the preceding term is odd; multiply by 3 and add 1 | step/rule 4: repeat steps until you arrive at 1 | fact: the sequence should ALWAYS end up at 1 if repeated. | . Algorithm to Start (Determining Whether a Number is Even or Odd) . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) if (varx %2 == 0): print(&quot;the number is even&quot;) else: print(&quot;the number is odd&quot;) # Run this cell to see how it works . choose value for x the number is odd . How can we modify this code to match our goal . Hint: uses arithmetic operations | Hint: look at the steps of the equation and try and modify it to fit them | Must display all numbers used in it | . Solution . Step 1 . steps/rules 2 &amp; 3. | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) if (varx %2 == 0): varx == varx/2 # Change print to the function else: varx == varx * 3 + 1 # Change print to the function print(varx) . choose value for x 7 . Step 2 . step/rule 4; here we add the loop | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) while varx != 1: if (varx %2 == 0): varx = varx/2 # Change print to the function else: varx = varx * 3 + 1 # Change print to the function print(varx) . choose value for x 1.0 . Step 3 . Display all values throughout the algorithm | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) print(varx) while varx != 1: if (varx %2 == 0): varx = varx/2 print(varx) # add Display else: varx = varx * 3 + 1 print(varx) # add Display print(varx) # Final # Should be 1 every time . choose value for x 4 2.0 1.0 1.0 . Takeaways . You can use code you&#39;ve previously wrote in order to make a project easier. | Breaking algorithms down into steps can make things easier and more simple. | . Hacks . create another algorithm using a famous mathematical algorithm such as the &quot;collatz conjecture.&quot; and explain your steps in a post on a blog. | . def Fibonacci(n): # Check if input is 0 then it will # print incorrect input if n &lt; 0: print(&quot;Incorrect input&quot;) # Check if n is 0 # then it will return 0 elif n == 0: return 0 # Check if n is 1,2 # it will return 1 elif n == 1 or n == 2: return 1 else: return Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2) # Driver Program print(Fibonacci(22)) . 17711 . 3.11 Binary Search . Goals/Objectives: . detirmine number of iterations required to find vlue in data set. | explain requirements for binary search | . What is Binary Search? . Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. | An algorithm for iterating to find a value inside a data set | . About Binary Search: . Binary Search Algorithm starts in the middle of a data set of numbers and eliminates half the data. This process reapeats until the desired value is found or until all elements have been eliminated. | In order to use binary search effectivly and properly, data must be stored in order | COLLEGE BOARD INDEX STARTS AT 1 NOT 0 | . Think about how you would you would try to find a certain number in this set. . One way would be to line up the numbers and count them individually untill you find the desired value. . When working with large data sets with lots of numbers, methods like these wont work . Instead, a Binary Search would be more effective. | . Here we can see the numbers are set in an increasing order. Setting numbers in an increasing or decreasing is needed for a binary search . Binary search is started with the middle number first Middle number is found by taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two | . | Binary Search can be represented using a tree as shown below | . . Heres an easy way to put it: . binary search fidns the desired element by continuously chopping the search area in half | say the element you are looking for is &#39;f&#39; | . [a b c d e f g h] . We would start in the middle at element &#39;d&#39; | becuase our target is greater than d we will eliminate everything left of &#39;d&#39; including &#39;d&#39; (chopping it in half) . [e f g h] is what now remains . again we would &#39;chop in half&#39; | say we iterate through &#39;g&#39; and &#39;h&#39;, our desired element is still not found so we would eliminate &#39;g; and &#39;h&#39; and continue the process | . [e f] . now we are down to 2 elements | &#39;chopping in half&#39; will give us our desired element | . [f] . | . def BinarySearch(array, x, low, high): # Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each other while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low)//2 # find the middle (taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two) if array[mid] == x: # if desired number is the middle is found return desired number (middle number) return mid elif array[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return -1 array = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] x = 4 result = BinarySearch(array, x, 0, len(array)-1) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not found&quot;) . Element is present at index 1 . We have created a function called binary_search() function which takes two arguments - a list to be sorted and a number to be searched. . | We have declared two variables to store the lowest and highest values in the list. The lowest is assigned initial value to 0, the highest to len(list1) 1 and mid as 0. . | Next, we have declared the while loop with the condition that the lowest is equal and smaller than the highest. The while loop will iterate if the number has not been found yet. . | In the while loop, we find the mid value and compare the index value to the number we are searching for. . | If the value of the mid-index is smaller than n, we increase the mid value by 1 and assign it to the low. The search moves to the left side. . | Otherwise, if the value of mid index is larger than n, we decrease the mid value by 1 and assign it to the high. The search moves to the right side. . | If the n is equal to the mid value then return mid. . | This will happen until the low is equal and smaller than the high. . | If we reach at the end of the function, then the element is not present in the list. We return -1 to the calling function. . | . . Hacks . Using my example above and steps below, create your own iteration using binary search . Steps . Compare x with the middle element. | If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index. | Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half. | Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half. | .

Coding all of these individually takes a lot of unnecessary time, how can we shorten this time? . Iteration . Iteration is the repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. There&#39;s a lot of types of iteration though, what to use? How do we apply iteration to lists? . Some methods include using a &quot;for loop&quot;, using a &quot;for loop and range()&quot;, using a &quot;while loop&quot;, and using comprehension . Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable objects. They are the &#39;containers&#39; that store the data to iterate. . Each of these containers are able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration:definite and indefinite. Definite iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met . for variable in iterable: statement() . Iterator? Iterable? Iteration? . When an object is iterable it can be used in an iteration | When passed through the function iter() it returns an iterator | Strings, lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples are all examples of iterable objects. | . a = [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;bravo&#39;, &#39;charlie&#39;] itr = iter(a) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) . alpha bravo charlie . Loops . Well, above is basically just printing them again, so how do we takes these iterators into something we can make use for? | Loops take essentially what we did above and automates it, here are some examples. | . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # using a for loop for i in list: #for item in the list, print the item print(i) . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # Taking the length of the list lengthList = len(list) # Iteration using the amount of items in the list for i in range(lengthList): print(list[i]) . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # Once again, taking the length of the list lengthList = len(list) # Setting the variable we are going to use as 0 i=0 # Iteration using the while loop # Argument saying WHILE a certain variable is a certain condition, the code should run while i &lt; lengthList: print(list[i]) i += 1 . Using the range() function . But wait, there&#39;s more . Need to save even more time? The above is useful for many occasions, but can get tedious fast, in this case, use range() | . x = range(5) for n in x: print(n) . 0 1 2 3 4 . Else, elif, and break .

A 2D array is simply just a list of lists. The example below is technically correct but... . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Conventially 2D arrays are written like below. This is because 2D arrays are meant to be read in 2 dimensions (hence the name). Writing them like below makes them easier to visualize and understand. . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Printing a 2D Array . We already know that we can&#39;t just print the matrix by calling it. We need to iterate through it to print it. . def print_matrix1(matrix): for i in range(len(matrix)): # outer for loop. This runs on i which represents the row. range(len(matrix)) is in order to iterate through the length of the matrix for j in range(len(matrix[i])): # inner for loop. This runs on the length of the i&#39;th row in the matrix (j changes for each row with a different length) print(matrix[i][j], end=&quot; &quot;) # [i][j] is the 2D location of that value in the matrix, kinda like a coordinate pair. [i] iterates to the specific row and [j] iterates to the specific value in the row. end=&quot; &quot; changes the end value to space, not a new line. print() # prints extra line. this is in the outer loop, not the inner loop, because it only wants to print a new line for each row . print(&quot;Raw matrix (list of lists): &quot;) print(keypad) print(&quot;Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration:&quot;) print_matrix1(keypad) print() . Raw matrix (list of lists): [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&#39; &#39;, 0, &#39; &#39;]] Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . def print_matrix2(matrix): for row in matrix: # Iterates through each &quot;row&quot; of matrix. Row is a dummy variable, it could technically be anything. It iterates through each value of matrix and each value is it&#39;s own list. in this syntax the list is stored in &quot;row&quot;. for col in row: # Iterates through each value in row. Again col, column, is a dummy variable. Each value in row is stored in col. print(col, end=&quot; &quot;) # Same as 1 print() # Same as 1 print_matrix2(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . More Functions . Try to find another way to print the matrix. Only complete one of the two (unless you&#39;d like to do both). Below is a hint . fruit = [&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;bananas&quot;, &quot;grapes&quot;] print(fruit) print(*fruit) # Python built in function: &quot;*&quot;. Figure out what it does .

Alternatively, find a way to print the matrix using the iter() function you already learned. Or use both! . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] . Print what month you were born and how old you are by iterating through the keyboard (don&#39;t just write a string). . print(keyboard[2][6], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[2][0], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[3][5], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[1][6], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[2][0], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[1][3], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[1][5], end=&quot;&quot;) #comma print(keyboard[3][7], end=&quot;&quot;) # age print(keyboard[0][1], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[0][5], end=&quot;&quot;) . JANUARY,15 . Challenge . Change all of the letters that you DIDN&#39;T print above to spaces, &quot; &quot;, and then print the full keyboard. (the things you did print should remain in the same spot) . Alternative Challenge: If you would prefer, animate it using some form of delay so it flashes one of your letters at a time on the board in order and repeats. (this one may be slightly more intuitive) . DO NOT HARD CODE THIS. Don&#39;t make it harder on yourself, iterate through, make it abstract so it can be used dynamically. You should be able to input any string and your code should work. . . 1 6 R A H C M . If you get stuck you can just make a picture with an array and print it (I will grade based on how good it looks) . I do expect an attempt so write some code to show you tried the challenge. .",

What is a boolean? . A data type with two possible values: true or false | . Boolean and Binary . So similar yet so different. . Boolean math and binary notation both use the same two ciphers: 1 and 0. | However, please note that Boolean quantities are restricted to a singlular bit (can only be either 1, or 0) | On the otherhand, binary numbers may be composed of many bits adding up in place-weighted form to any finite value, or size | . Must Knows . A Boolean value is either TRUE or FALSE | The AP Exam will provide you with a reference sheet with the operators below. | . A few ways these operators could be used... | . Relational Operators in action . How could you use operators to determine if the average of 5 grades is greater than 80? | . With the grades below, use a boolean expression to determine if the average grade is above an 80 and print the result (True or False) | Try it in as few steps as possible! | Be creative! There are obviously TONS of different practical solutions | . grade1 = 90 grade2 = 65 grade3 = 60 grade4 = 75 grade5 = 95 gradeAvg = (grade1+grade2+grade3+grade4+grade5)/5 print(gradeAvg &gt; 80) . False . The versatility of relational operators: . print(&quot;100 == 100:&quot;,100==100) print(&quot;Hello == Adios:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;==&quot;farewell&quot;) print(&quot;Hello != Adios:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;!=&quot;farewell&quot;) print(&quot;Hello == Hola:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;==&quot;greeting&quot;) print(&quot;5&gt;=4:&quot;, 5&gt;=4) print (&#39;&#39;) # Notice that relational operators can even work on lists! # For lists, the relational operator compares each respective component until an answer is derived print(&quot;[&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]:&quot;, [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]) . 100 == 100: True Hello == Adios: False Hello != Adios: True Hello == Hola: True 5&gt;=4: True [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]: False [1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]: True [1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]: False [1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]: False . Logical Operators! . These types of operators don&#39;t necessarily deal with equivalent/non-equivalent values, but they rather work on operands to produce a singular boolean result . AND : returns TRUE if the operands around it are TRUE | OR : returns TRUE if at least one operand is TRUE | NOT : returns TRUE if the following boolean is FALSE | . Turn the following arithmetic phrases into either True or False statements as indicated USING LOGICAL OPERATORS . print(&quot;1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12:&quot;, 1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12) # Output TRUE using OR ^ # Output FALSE using NOT print(&quot;24 &gt; 8:&quot;,24 &gt; 8) # Output FALSE using AND print(&quot;10 &gt; 20:&quot;, 10 &gt; 20 and False) . 1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12: True 24 &gt; 8: True 10 &gt; 20: False . Lesson Overview: 3.6 - Conditionals . Focusing on Selection . Selection: uses a condition that evaluates to true or false . Selection determines which part of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false . Algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task . Conditional Statements . Also known as &quot;if statements&quot; . Can be seen as if statements or if blocks . Can also be seen as if else statements or if else-blocks . x = 20 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) . x is greater than y . x = 9 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is not greater than y&quot;) . x is not greater than y .

Restaurants are recommended based on whether they can accommodate all allergies and dietary restrictions, not based on whether group members have been there before. Information about which food allergies and dietary restrictions can be accommodated at nearby restaurants is needed so that a restaurant can be recommended for the group. . Question 28 . This code segment incorrectly charges customers who use more than 25 units of electricity. These customers are charged $7 per unit for all units, when they should be charged this rate only for the number of units above 25. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 – 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. This code segment would incorrectly charge the customer $224 for the 32 units. . Question 35 . The last line in this code segment sets maxPS to 50 regardless of the value of time. . Question 42 . After initially assigning values to the variables, the code segment assigns the value 4 to num3 and assigns the value 8 to num1. The value of sum at the end of the code segment is 8 + 4 + 4, or 16. . Question 43 . This is the value of x after the code segment is executed, not the value of result. . Question 47 . The eighth statement assigns the value of c + d / 2 (which is 50) to d. .

Some arts displayed immense realism, while some were just geometric designs. One artwork I ran across that peaked my interest is shown below. . . Computer Animation 1 . Last year when I was a freshman, I took this class. For the first trimester final you are supposed to create a digital created scene with a donut, water cup, table, chair and room with some sort of background. This class was very interesting seeing the different types of unique ways people designed their scenes. I chose one scene that I thought looked the best below. . . Ceramics . I never took ceramics, but just by looking at it, it looks hard. When I was walking around the classroom I saw an octopus shaped object.

The main issue when trying to complete the assignment was when running the command “sudo docker-compose up -d”, here was the issue I was presented with: . . Originally I had a parsing error which was caused by me placing the wrong code into the “docker compose yml file”. The way I fixed this was by opening the flask repository in vscode, and manually copying and pasting the code there and pushing it. . . Going back to the current issue, some ways I tried resolving was making sure my team’s individual flask’s were set up correctly meaning they were on different ports, and had the correct directory implemented in their docker compose yml file. I also reached out to Mr Yeung, who attempted to help me, but was not able to. .",

            "content": "1.1: Daily Video 1 . A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function | A computing innovation can be physical, nonphysical computer software, or nonphysical computing concept | Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias in the development of computing innovations | Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it | . Daily Video 1: Takeaways . Interpersonal skills learned through collaboration: Communication | Consensus Building | Conflict Resolution | Negotiation | . | . 1.1: Daily Video 2 . Pair Programming Two programmers work together as a pair | One programmer is the driver, who writes code, and the other programmer is the observer/pointer/navigator, who reviews each line of code as it is typed in | . | Think-Pair-Share Students first think through a problem by themselves, pair up with a partner to exchange ideas, and then share findings with the class | . | Leave Comments in Code! Communicate to your partner(s) | Communicate to yourself | Acknowledge code segments used from other sources | Acknowledge media used from other sources | Differentiate what you and your partner(s) did | Clarify the functionality of your code | . | How to Collaborate in Class Online Tools repl.it - multiplayer | GitHub - collaboration and repository | Shared document or folder | . | Ask friends and family to test drive your prgoram and give you feedback! | Check with your teacher for your coding platform | . | . Daily Video 2: Takeaways . Consultation and communication with users are important aspects of the development of computing innovations | Information gathered from potential users can be used to understand the purpose of a program from diverse perspectives and to develop a program that fully incorporates these perspectives | Online tools support collaboration by allowing programmers to share and provide feedback on ideas and documents | Common models such as pair programming exist to facilitate collaboration | . Personal Takeways . Watching these videos definitely opened my mind to how crucial collaboration is, especially in a field like computer science. I hope that from now on, my team and I will be able to communicate with each other and help each other no matter the circumstances. . 1.2: Daily Video 1 . Computing Innovations . Innovations can include, but are not limited to: . Applications Games | Social Media | Business | Productivity | . | Physical Devices Computers | Smart Phones/tablets | Smart “Things” | Wearables | . | Systems E-commerce | Cloud services | E-mail | . | . Innovations Created for a Purpose . Guiding Questions: . Why does the computing innovation exist? | What problem(s) does the computing innovation solve? | What does the computing innovation allow us to do that we could not do before? | Examples of Computing Innovations . Social Media Applications Allows users to connect from a distance and archive their activites | . | E-commerce Allows users to save time and money by being able to shop from home | . | Digital Assistant Device Allows users to control their devices hands-free making them safer while driving or more convenient when trying to multitask | . | . Daily Video 1: Takeaways . The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interest through creative expression | An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovations provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation | . 1.2: Daily Video 2 . Identifying Inputs to Programs . Computer Programs accept input in a variety of different forms: . tactile (touch) | audio | visual | text (including numerical values) | . Examples: . Smart phone/tablet (texting, entering password, etc.) | Laptop computer (keyboard, mouse, etc.) | Gaming console (send input through buttons) | . How do programs receive input? . Most programs are written in an event driven environment. . “Events” are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program | . Types of events a user can trigger: . mouse clicks | screen taps/swipes (force touch) | . What does input accomplish in a program? . Input usually affects the output. Outputs produced by a device can include: . visual | audio | tactile (touch/feel) | text | . Example of output that devices supply: . Smart phone/tablet (things that appear on screen based on what you have pressed/swiped) | Laptop computer (displays texts after using keyboard) | Gaming console (remote vibrations) | . How does a program know what to do upon an event? . An action triggers an event: . Action may be activated by the user or another program/device | . The program “jumps” to the code segment according to the event: . The code segment is ran | Output is triggered by the code segment/additional events that are triggered | . The program does not necessarily execute “in order”: . Code segments are executed as they are called, according to the events triggered | . Daily Video 2: Takeaways . Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text | An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program | Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution | Inputs USUALLY affect the output produced by a program | Program output is usually based on a program’s input or prior state | . 1.2: Daily Video 3 . What is a program? . A program is a collection of statements: . A statement is a single command | A group of statements is called a code segment | A program is often referred to as “software” | Code segments are executed by rules of the coding language | . What does the program shown in the video do? - written to find the minimum value in a list . The code segment should work for a variety of different lists, such as numbers that are out of order, negative numbers, large numbers, and decimals | . Description . Simply state what the segment does this way, someone else can use the segment in a larger program | . | Include how it does what it does this way, someone could expand upon the code segment | . | . Daily Video 3: Takeaways . A program is a collection of program statements that performs a task when run by a computer | A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program | A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations | . Personal Takeways . After watching all three videos, I feel that I truly understand why knowing the purpose and function of a program is essential. Knowing exactly what your program is intended to do could allow someone who is reading it to use it in a larger program or even expand upon it. Overall, having knowledge about this big idea will definitely be helpful and I will apply this idea to anything that I do in this class. . 1.3: Daily Video 1 . How is a program developed? . It all starts with an idea. . Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan | At times, the development is more exploratory than anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad) | . Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect . Investigation is an important step in the process | Developers must: determine the requirements of the program | understand the constraints | understand the user concerns and interests | . | How do developers investigate? surveys | user testing | interviews | direct observations | . | . After initial investigation and reflection… . Developers design the program by brainstorming (draw on investigation) | storyboarding the program | planning user experience | laying out the user interface | organizing into modules | develop a testing strategy | . | Developers decide on the program requirements that… describe how a program should behave | include a list of user interactions | . | The program specifications outline all of the requirements | Developers create a prototype of the program (or components): a gradual process is frequently used so that developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program | . | . Testing, testing, and more testing! . Developers test the program every step of the way | Testing occurs at the micro level | macro level | . | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection | . Daily Video 1 Personal Takeaways . After watching the first daily video of 1.3, I now realize that if I want to have my idea for the final project behave like it is supposed to that numerous trials of the program will have to be run. This way, we can all see what parts of the program should be kept as is and which parts need to be modified to ensure optimal user experience. . 1.3: Daily Video 2 . How is a program developed? . Program development is seldom a solo endeavor . Typically, programs are developed by teams of people | Individuals/teams work on different functional components | Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work | Their names must be written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project | . While documentation is an important place to give credit… . Many projects use comments within the programming language to give credit | This is an important part of the development of the program | When developers find a bug/error in a program, they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem | This may be most useful after a program is completed, and users find additional bugs | . Many times developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms, and more that are written by others. . These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited | Similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article | Any code segments, procedures, or algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author | The program documentation should include the author’s name and the source of any code segments being used | This portion of the documentation may resemble a bibliography or a works cited pages in a research paper | . Daily Video 2 Personal Takeways . I now know that any time I use code segments or algorithms, whether they are from my teammates or outside sources, I should always in some way give credit to the original author of that part of the program. This is because any code segments, procedures, or algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author. . 1.3: Daily Video 3 . How is a program developed? . Programmers create something called program documentation in order to… . describe the overall program | list program specifications | describe… functions/procedures/methods within the code | specific code segments | list of events and corresponding outputs | the development of the program | how other programs may interact with the program | . | list of contributors/authors of the program | . When does documentation happen? . Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: . At the beginning: list specifications | During: to keep track of proceess | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throughout can improve: | efficiency of overall programming process | programmers’ ability to test and refine the program | programmers’ response to bugs | . How do programmers document while programming? . Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not. . Commenting allows programmers to write text within the prgoram | This text does not affect the program | Comments are for programmers to read | This is a form of documentation and can be very usefil when programmers collaborate or work individually | . Daily Video 3 Personal Takeways . After watching this video, I now understand why it is important to include comments in code, as it allows one to understand what something does and how it was developed. . Collaberation Quiz (MCQ): . . Program Function and Development Quiz (MCQ): . . Program Design and Development Quiz (MCQ): . . Questions: . What better techniques could be used to gain more collaberation in a group? | How are the Psuedo code questions on the MCQ implementing techniques we’ve learned? | .",

First I made a “correct” and “incorrect”, and “start” screen. I also made the “quiz1” , “quiz2” , and “quiz3” screens that showed the questions. When the user starts the code, he is prompted with a start quiz button, once clicked he is directed to the quiz1 screen. If the answer is answerd correctly, the score will be logged +1 and the user will be redirected to the correct screen. If answerd incorrect, the score will be logged -1 and the user will be redirected to the incorrect screen. At the end the code brings up the “FinalScore” screen which shows the percent you got on the quiz. . Data Abstraction . In the image below you can see how I logged the score throughout the code.

            "content": "Idea 1 . Performance Task/Program Purpose and Function . For my APCSP project, I want to make an program that requests from blockchain APIs, and find if a transaction has confirmed towards a certain bitcoin address . The user will be able to input a bitcoin address or a TXID(transaction hash) into the program for the results. . Data Abstraction . In this program the data requested by the API’s will be stored in a dictionary. The program will access the data in the lists and dictionaries, and run them through functions that check if the transaction confirmed or is unconfirmed. The program will also store data about the transaction like fees, and dates on when the transaction was initiated. . Managing Complexity . This is still being thought out, but the main idea is to ideitify information based on a transation using the blockchain. It will output data like the transaction fees, and how long it takes or took the transaction to confirm on the blockchain. . Procedural Abstraction . The procedure for this program is to first take a TXID input by the user, then to request from blockchain APIs about the transaction. The API responses are then saved in a dictionary that are extracted and formated for the user to interpret. . Algorithm Implementation . The algorithm implementation would have to do with parsing/iterating the data saved in the dictionary. My program would need to assosiate variables with certain data. The Algorithm would need to loop through the data to output the right information the user. . Testing . For the testing, I will demonstrate how to use the program through a short video. I will also include a written documentation that explains how the program works as well as how to use it. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
