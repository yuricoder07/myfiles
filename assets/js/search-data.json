Now it&#39;s time to do some coding... . | Run code and then research and answer these questions... . Is a list and/or dictionary in python considered a primitive or collection type? Why?A list and a dictionary are considered collection types rather than primitive types. They are implemented using more complex data structures and algorithms than the primitive types. For example, a list in Python is typically implemented as a dynamic array, while a dictionary is usually implemented using a hash table. These data structures and algorithms are more complex than those used to implement primitive types, which is why they are considered collection types. . | Is the list passed into bubble sort &quot;pass-by-value&quot; or &quot;pass-by-reference? Describe why in relation to output.The list passed into bubble sort is passed by reference, not by value. When a variable is passed as an argument to a function, a reference to the object is passed, not a copy of the object itself. . | . | Implement new cell(s) and/or organize cells to do the following.

Picture Encoding . Essential Question: What are some methods that we could store and access images in the backend, and how can we send them to a frontend application? . The image encoding process for this project is done within the endpoints created on our backend application. The overarching process is split into three seperate sub-processes, each handling a different level of game-difficulty. For this lesson, we will look at the easy images sub-process as our example. . def get_random_easy_image(): images = Images.query.filter_by(_difficulty=0).all() image = random.choice(images) return image . This procedure is a void function that takes in no arguments directly, but does access the database via the Images object imported from the models that we created . The first line filters all database entries and searches for all image entries with the difficulty column set to 0, which we established as the identifying factor for easy images. The .all() method attached to the end of the query serves to return all matching image objects in a list called image. . The procedure finally returns a random image using the random.choice method. . class ImagesAPI: class _EasyImages(Resource): def get(self): image = get_random_easy_image() json_data = {} if image: image_path = project_path + &quot;/&quot; + image.imagePath with open(image_path, &quot;rb&quot;) as image_file: json_data[&quot;bytes&quot;] = str(base64.b64encode(image_file.read()))[2:][:-1] json_data[&quot;xCoord&quot;] = image.xCoord json_data[&quot;yCoord&quot;] = image.yCoord return jsonify(json_data) . If the first procedure locates and selects the image, the second procedure then encodes, formats, and returns the JSON data containing the image and its metadata. . The procedure first calls the get_random_easy_image() procedure created earlier to store our image object and also initializes an empty dictionary to store our json data. . If a valid image object is found, the procedure will attempt to create an absolute path to the image file on the computer running flask application. This is achieved by concatenating the absolute path of the working project directory to the relative image path stored in the database. The aboslute path of the directory is generated in our namespace package (__init__.py) in our _nighthawkguessr_api_ package. The line calculating the project path is shown below, and uses the Path object from the pathlib library. . project_path = Path.cwd().as_posix() . After creating the image path, the procedure attempts to open the image file, and procedes to use the base64.b64encode method to encode the image file bytes into base64 data. This is convinient for us as HTML on the frontend pages allows us to render images with base64 bytes (Not sure about normal image bytes). The base64 bytes are then encoded into a python literal string in order to be jsonified and displayed on the api endpoint. The [2:][:-1] appended to the end is a type of string slicing which removes the b&#39; generated at the start of the data and the &#39; generated at the end of the data. These extraneous characters are used to indicate a base64 string, and are not part of the original data. . The procedure finally appends the metadata (position of the right coordinates on the map) to the json_data dictionary, completing the process. . Finally, the procedure returns the JSONified data, which is accessible from our API. As you can see, the images we process are extremely large and possess high resolution (typically a few megabytes!) . Popcorn Hack: . Please write a few sentences answering the essential question, &quot;What are some methods that we could store and access images in the backend, and how can we send them to a frontend application?&quot; . Some methods that we can use to store and access images in the backend includes:database storage, cloud storage and file system storage. we can send them to a frontend application by using data urls, urls, and base64 encoding. | . Endpoints . What are endpoints and how do we use them to transfer data from one part of the internet to another? . Backend: . The backend creates endpoints that are used to edit the properties of the database constructed by the model. | GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods are used in order to define HTTP endpoints in the API. These endpoints are based on requests that can be made to change the database. | Variables defined in the model file are used to call data from the database in order to be manipulated. | . | . Methods in Backend Example . Modules are being imported with specified classes which are used later in the program. Blueprint: used to organize the routes and functions | request: used to access data sent to the Flask app. through the HTTP request | Api: creates a Flask instance that handles requests | Resource: this allows for the definition of custom HTTP requests | reqparse: used to parse (sort and search) and validate data that is requested | . | The blueprint and api are then defined as variables and are used to store any future data that is requested. | Some preliminary functions, such as find_by_username, are created to be used later in the API code, allowing for simpler code. In this case, these functions are used to search through the database to find specific usernames. | . | . from flask import Blueprint, request from flask_restful import Api, Resource, reqparse # setting variables used to store future data leaderboard_bp = Blueprint(&quot;leaderboards&quot;, __name__) leaderboard_api = Api(leaderboard_bp) # pre-made function created to search for usernames, allows for simplified program def find_by_username(username): users = Leaderboard.query.filter_by(_username=username).all() return users[0] . GET Method . This method is used to fetch specific data points from the database by searching through the usernames. | This will be different for each type of database being made, however the general format stays the same. Since this is a text database, to pull specific information from the database, the API will search through the data using the username, which is unique. | The function defined previously, find_by_username(), is used to search through the database and pull the specific data point that is being searched. | If the user exists, the data of that user will be returned, being sent to the frontend of the program. | If a user isn&#39;t found, an error will be returned that the user does not exist. | . | In general, the program will always be searching for a piece of information that is unique and that will be used to pull data to wherever it is being requested. | . def get(self): # requested username turned into variable for later use username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) # username used to search for data and the found data is made into a variable user = find_by_username(username) if user: # data is sent to the frontend return user.to_dict() # error checking return {&quot;message&quot;: user}, 404 . POST Method . This method is used to add a specific piece of information in the database based on searching by usernames. | This is again different for each database that is made, however the general structure stays the same. In this example, a parser is being used to extract data from an incoming request. In this case, the RequestParser class is used from the Flask module. All required arguments are added to the parser, specifying what type of data it is. | The args variable is added in order to parse and store all incoming data. | . | The variable leaderboard is created to make a new object that will contain the values from the incoming data. | The function will attempt to add a new entry in the leaderboard database and return a status of a successful addition of the data. | If there is an error in the data being inputted, a status code of 500 will be returned. | . | . def post(self): # using parsers to gather and data that is to be posted and validate it&#39;s true parser = reqparse.RequestParser() parser.add_argument(&quot;username&quot;, required=True, type=str) parser.add_argument(&quot;password&quot;, required=True, type=str) parser.add_argument(&quot;pointsEasy&quot;, required=True, type=int) parser.add_argument(&quot;pointsMedium&quot;, required=True, type=int) parser.add_argument(&quot;pointsHard&quot;, required=True, type=int) # variable made to store data args = parser.parse_args() # variable created to format all data into one place and send to database for logging leaderboard = Leaderboard(args[&quot;username&quot;], args[&quot;password&quot;], args[&quot;pointsEasy&quot;], args[&quot;pointsMedium&quot;], args[&quot;pointsHard&quot;]) try: # data is sent to the database for storage db.session.add(leaderboard) db.session.commit() return leaderboard.to_dict(), 201 except Exception as e: # error checking db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . PUT Method . This method is used to update a specific piece of information in the database based on searching by usernames. | For each data base that is made, there will be different specific but the overall structure stays the same. First, the username variable is defined, which retrieves the requested username and sets it as a variable that will be used later to edit a specific dataset. | The function find_by_username() is again used to search through the data to look for the username requested. This is set to a variable to be used later. | If the username is found in the database, the rest of the dataset is updated with the new values requested. This is updated into the database. | If there is an error found with the data requested of it the user isn&#39;t found, an error is returned. | . | . def put(self): # variable created to make requested username into something that can be used to search for data in future username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) try: # attempts to find the data in the database user = find_by_username(username) if user: # if the data is found, the data points are updates user.pointsEasy = int(request.get_json().get(&quot;pointsEasy&quot;)) user.pointsMedium = int(request.get_json().get(&quot;pointsMedium&quot;)) user.pointsHard = int(request.get_json().get(&quot;pointsHard&quot;)) db.session.commit() return user.to_dict(), 201 else: # if user not found, error is returned return {&quot;message&quot;: &quot;leaderboard not found&quot;}, 404 except Exception as e: # checks for errors in request db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . DELETE Method . This method is used to delete a specific information from the database, again searching by username. | The overall structure stays the same between different databases, but the specific variables will need to be changed to personalize the database. A variable for the username is created in order to search for for the user name requested later in the code with the function find_by_username(). | If the user is found, the user is deleted, along with that user&#39;s data and the change is saved to the database. | If the user isn&#39;t found or if an error is found with the data requested, an error is returned. | . | . def delete(self): # username variable defined to store requested value username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) try: # finds the username and stores data in variable user = find_by_username(username) if user: # if the user is found, the user and their data is deleted db.session.delete(user) db.session.commit() return user.to_dict() else: # if user not found, error is returned return {&quot;message&quot;: &quot;leaderboard not found&quot;}, 404 except Exception as e: # error checking for request error db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . Displaying the Full Database . Another class is created in order to display the entire database at once and also to delete the entire database if necessary. | This uses the same functions as before to GET and DELETE the data, however it is modified slightly to look through the entire database abd display or delete all data points. | An example of where this would be useful is to create a table of data in the frontend. | . class LeaderboardListAPI(Resource): # GET method def get(self): try: # attempts to find the entire database requested and is stored in variable leaderboards = db.session.query(Leaderboard).all() # sends back the entire database return [leaderboard.to_dict() for leaderboard in leaderboards] except Exception as e: # error checking for request errors db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 # DELETE method def delete(self): try: # deletes entire database db.session.query(Leaderboard).delete() db.session.commit() return [] except Exception as e: # checks for errors in request db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . Popcorn Hacks . Please answer these questions to earn points for the popcorn hacks. . What are the four HTTP request methods that are used with Flask? | The 4 methods are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE . What is a parser and how would it be aid with data validation? | Parser is a tool that allows you to extract structured data from unstructured or semi-structured input data for example, json. It would aid with data validation since you can prevent malformed data from causing something to break in your application . What is the role endpoints in Flask? | In Flask, an endpoint is a function that maps to a specific URL route. When a user makes an HTTP request to a particular URL, Flask will route the request to the appropriate endpoint function based on the URL pattern. . Frontend and How it Communicates to Backend . This first part of the frontend logic simply finds out of the site is running locally or not, off of which is figures out whether or not to pull data from the local backend link or the global backend link. In this example, a global backend link hasn&#39;t been sent, however it would go in the second set of quotations after the local address. This isn&#39;t something you need to know, but it is nice to use when developing full stack applications. . // checks if site is run locally const isLocalhost = Boolean( window.location.hostname === &quot;localhost&quot; || window.location.hostname === &quot;[::1]&quot; || window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?: .(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/) ) // defines database url const api = isLocalhost ? &quot;http://localhost:8200&quot; : &quot;&quot;; . GET Method . This method is more complicated in terms of requesting, simply because in order to, for example, print all data points into a table, the function needs to iterate through the entire database. | In this example, the function getList() is used to asynchronously fetch the entire database and set it to a variable called list. The list is returned for later use outside of this function in order to print the data. | . | . Printing the Data . In order to print the data, the function getList() is run and once it is run, it iterates through the data to pull out each individual data point and enter it into the function used to make the table. For each class in the database, which is each row in the database, the variables corresponding to that specific class are pulled and inserted into the addTask() function as parameters to create the table of users. | . | The function addTask() is used to create the visual table that the user sees. A row is created and for each table cell in that row, the data is added by iterating through the array of variables that are parameters pulled directly from the database. | A new row is added into table for each new class of information pulled from the database. | . | . // fetches entire database const getList = async () =&gt; { // stores it in variable list const list = await fetch(api + &quot;/leaderboardList&quot;).then((r) =&gt; r.json()); return list }; // goes through entire database and pulls each individual class getList().then(list =&gt; { // for each class (row), data is pulled and added into addTask() function to be put in visual table list.forEach(cls =&gt; { addTask(cls.username, cls.pointsEasy, cls.pointsMedium, cls.pointsHard) }) }) // adds visual representation of data in table function addTask(username, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard) { // array of variables defining data points var tableCells = [username, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard] // creates new row in variable var row = document.createElement(&#39;tr&#39;) // goes through entire data set and places data into cells for (var i = 0; i &lt; tableCells.length; i++) { var tableCell = document.createElement(&#39;th&#39;) tableCell.textContent = tableCells[i] tableCell.className = &#39;cell&#39; row.appendChild(tableCell) } // creates new row as child of schedule element schedule.appendChild(row) } . POST Method . This method is used to push data to the backend using the HTTP POST method. The function addData is defined with the parameters that are going to be pushed into the backend. | An object is created to define the variables that are going to be pushed into the backend. This is basically the JSON string that will be sent to the backend to get decoded and inserted into the database. | The fetch() function is called with the api variable, which is a variable representing the url for the backend API, and the extension specific to where the data will be posted, in this case being /leaderboard. The method, headers, and body of the data are defined in order to complete a successful HTTP request to the backend. The object data which was created earlier, is converted to a JSON string here and sent to the backend. | . | If an error is detected, it is returned and the request will fail. | . | . // calls addData function function addData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // creates object defining the variables that will be added to the backend, corresponding with the backend variables let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // POST method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;POST&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . PUT and DELETE Methods . These two methods are almost identical to the POST method above in the way they work, the only difference being that the method requested is different. The name of the function defined is also changes, in this case being editData() and deleteData(). | . // editing function defined function editData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // has object with variables that are required in backend let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // PUT method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;PUT&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . // deleting function defined function deleteData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // object defined with variables that are same as backend let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // DELETE method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;DELETE&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . Calling Images (GET Method) . The process for calling images is basically the same as anything else, except you need to be able to reconstruct the images based on the base64 that is requested from the backend. | In this case, the image in the api is being called to the frontend and is returned as the variable list. This is then inserted directly into the html by getting the element that needs to be edited and styling with css by using the built-in function data:image/png;base64, which translated from bytes to pixel. | . | . // GET method calling info from backend url const getList = async () =&gt; { const list = await fetch(api + &quot;/api/images/GetEasyImage&quot;).then((r) =&gt; r.json()); return list }; // inserting image into frontend getList().then(list =&gt; { document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;body&quot;)[0].style = &quot;background-image: url(&#39;data:image/png;base64, &quot; + list.bytes +&quot;&#39;);&quot; }) . Popcorn Hacks . Please answer these questions to earn points for the popcorn hacks. . How is data for images stored in a Flask API and how is it displayed on the frontend when requested? | Images are stored in a Flask API by storing images as files on a server or storing image data in a database as binary data or URLs or using cloud storage services. When requested, its displayed typically using Base64 . What is the fetch() function and how is it used in frontend logic? | fetch() allows you to make HTTP requests to a server from a frontend application and is used in frontend logic to retrieve data from a server API. . How is data formatted and sent to the backend? (mention JSON in your answer) | When sending data to the backend in a Flask API, JSON is used to format for data serialization. JSON is easily parsed and generated by both backend and frontend applications . Time and Space Complexity of Algorithms . The lesson for time and space complexity of algorithms will consist of demonstrations of sorting algorithms and the different time complexities that they come with on a small scale. This can be acomplished using things such as a deck of cards or even with actual people. An example of how this will work is laying out the cards in a random order on the table, and demonstrating different ways of sorting it. From methods such as bubble sort to methods such as bogo sort, it will be really easy to see exactly how much time it would take for these different sorting algoritms to complete. Then after that, it is easy to understand the concept of time complexity when given a real world example. . Space complexity can be demonstrated by using the same method, however, adding in the extra step of having the cards in a pile. This will show how much space is needed to complete the sorting algorithm. This will easily reveal the concept of space complexity because it allows people to witness a real world, physical example of the concept, turning a really hard to grasp concept into something that is easy to understand. . Additionally, we are also going to analyze certain algorithms within our project to show how such analysis is applicable to real world projects. . Essential Question: What is the quicksort algorithm, and how does it work? How does it&#39;s time and space complexities scale with input sizes? . QuickSort Algorithm . The main algorithm we&#39;ve employed is an recursive implementation of quickSort in the backend to sort the database entries to obtain the user with the highest overall score. Typically this algorithm is implemented to sort in ascending order, but to make it easier to extract the top 10 users, we sill be modifying the algorithm to sort in descending order (so the top players show up first in the list). . class LeaderboardTop10(Resource): def partition(self, arr, lo, hi): pivot = arr[hi][1] # Pivot value set to the 2nd index of the last element pivot_pos = lo - 1 # Set our base pivot position, ensure that lower picoit index == lo for idx in range(lo, hi): # Iterate over all elements in the partition array if arr[idx][1] &gt;= pivot: # Found an element creater than pivot pivot_pos+=1 # Increment correct position for pivot arr[pivot_pos], arr[idx] = arr[idx], arr[pivot_pos] # Swap the larger element with the element at the current pivot position arr[pivot_pos + 1], arr[hi] = arr[hi], arr[pivot_pos + 1] # Swap element at pivot position with the pivot element return pivot_pos+1 # Return index of pivot element def qSortUserList(self, arr, lo, hi): if lo &lt; hi: last_pivot = self.partition(arr, lo, hi) self.qSortUserList(arr, lo, last_pivot-1) self.qSortUserList(arr, last_pivot+1, hi) def get(self): users_list = get_user_list() top10 = {} self.qSortUserList(users_list, 0, len(users_list)-1) for user in users_list: top10[user[0]] = user[1] print(top10) if len(top10) &lt;= 10: return top10 return top10[:10] . To understand how the algorithm first, we must first familiarize ourselves with the process. . Our backend grabs all users from our leaderboard | Returns all users and their scores in a 2-D array, each element is a list of length two that contains the username and cumulative score of the player | The sorting algorithm will use the second element representing the user score to sort the array of users. ┌─────────────────────┐ ┌──────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ Split │ │ display │ │ Database │ │ the ├──────────────► sorted list │ │ │ │ List into │ │ on endpoint │ │ │ │ top 10 users │ │ │ └──────────┬──────────┘ └─────────▲────────┘ └─────────────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ┌──────────▼──────────┐ ┌─────────┴────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ 2-D User Array │ │ QuickSort │ │ ├───────────────► │ │ [(username, score)] │ │ Algorithm │ │ │ │ │ └─────────────────────┘ └──────────────────┘ . Our quickSort algorithm consists of 2 procedures, a partition() procedure that pivots and sorts individual elements, and a qSortUserList() that performs recursion which finishes the sorting. | The Logic . The partition procedure will serve to &quot;partition&quot; our list into 2 parts, a smaller portion and a larger portion around a certain pivot value (Note: These portions don&#39;t have to sorted yet!). . Partition procedure . First, partition selects a certain element in a list to be a pivot. This pivot value will be used to make comparisons to every other value in the array. For simplicity, we have selected our pivot element as the last element in the unsorted list. The procedure defines a pivot_pos variable to denote the correct position of the pivot index after each iteration. Although it may seem weird that the variable intially starts with a value of 0-1 = -1, this negative index is resolved by the return statement, which always returns an index that&#39;s one higher than pivot_pos. This serves to ensure that the lowest pivot index would be 0, which is the smallest element in any given partition. . pivot = arr[hi][1] pivot_pos = lo - 1 . The partition will then iterate over each element in the list from the starting and ending indexes indicated by the parameters. if a particular value is found to be larger than the pivot, the algorithm well then increment the recorded pivot position and swap the pivot with the found element. . for idx in range(lo, hi): if arr[idx][1] &gt;= pivot: pivot_pos+=1 arr[pivot_pos], arr[idx] = arr[idx], arr[pivot_pos] . Finally, the partition procedure swaps the element at the pivot_pos+1 index with our pivot element at the hi index to place the pivot at it&#39;s rightful place. We know that pivot_pos+1 must be smaller than hi because it did not trigger the conditional to increment the `pivot_pos+1`` index. At last, the pivot_pos is incremented and returned to serve as an indicator of where our two partitions split. . arr[pivot_pos + 1], arr[hi] = arr[hi], arr[pivot_pos + 1] return pivot_pos+1 . qSort procedure . If the parition procedure splits our list into smaller and larger regions, then our qSort procedure ensures that these regions are in order. It&#39;s hard to explain, but the procedure iterates over each paritition, repeating the paritition process, setting new pivot values, and correctly places the pivot values at their correct sorted order. . The procedure first checks if the lower index is smaller than the higher index, to ensure that our parition has a length greater than 1. If this check passes, the procedure then calls the partition procedure to both split our list into the two distinct regions and also the index of our correctly placed pivot value. The procedure then invokes itself again on the larger interval (replacing hi to be the partition index-1 since the previous pivot is already sorted), and also on the smaller interval (replacing lo to be partition index+1). . Eventually, the qSort procedure will iterate through all elements in the list while parition places each element at the correct position, giving us the final sorted list. . Complexity analysis . To analyze time complexity, we must analyze the partition and qSort procedures. . For the qSort procedure, because we divide the array into 2 halves during each function call, our number of function calls scales proportionally to log(n), where n is the length of the input array. However, within each function call, we also call the partition procedure, which contains an for-loop that iterates over each element in the partioned array, comparing it to a pivot value. We are well familiar with since loops, and can safely say that runtime scales proportionally to the length of the partition array. Due to this, we can conclude that our iteration time complexity scales linearly. Thus for each iterative process, our timerun scales proportionally to n. . Finally, we could multiply our two complexities together to get a representation of our overall complexity. Thus, the asymptotic notation for a time complexity could be represented as O(nlogn), where n is the length of the input array. Keep in mind, Big-Oh notation is not a function that returns the accurate runtime for any given input, but rather only gives us a model to see how runtime scales with increasing input sizes. . Space complexity for this program is much easier to analyze. Because the array is sorted in-place (meaning we don&#39;t create other placeholders or copies), we require no additional space to sort this array. However, recursive function calls may require extra storage on the call stack. Since we found the number of recursive calls to be asymptotic to Olog(n), we can conclude that quickSort has an O(1) space complexity for an iterative method, and an O(logn) space complexity for a recursive method. . Popcorn Hack . Please answer our EQ for this section: What is the quicksort algorithm, and how does it work? How does it&#39;s time and space complexities scale with input sizes? . It&#39;s a sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array of elements. You select a &quot;pivot&quot; element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The time complexity of Quicksort is O(n log n). | . Hacks - Frontend and Backend . Attempted to do Frontend and Backend (spent 7+ hours but couldn&#39;t figure it out so we gave up) .

Picture Encoding . Essential Question: What are some methods that we could store and access images in the backend, and how can we send them to a frontend application? . The image encoding process for this project is done within the endpoints created on our backend application. The overarching process is split into three seperate sub-processes, each handling a different level of game-difficulty. For this lesson, we will look at the easy images sub-process as our example. . def get_random_easy_image(): images = Images.query.filter_by(_difficulty=0).all() image = random.choice(images) return image . This procedure is a void function that takes in no arguments directly, but does access the database via the Images object imported from the models that we created . The first line filters all database entries and searches for all image entries with the difficulty column set to 0, which we established as the identifying factor for easy images. The .all() method attached to the end of the query serves to return all matching image objects in a list called image. . The procedure finally returns a random image using the random.choice method. . class ImagesAPI: class _EasyImages(Resource): def get(self): image = get_random_easy_image() json_data = {} if image: image_path = project_path + &quot;/&quot; + image.imagePath with open(image_path, &quot;rb&quot;) as image_file: json_data[&quot;bytes&quot;] = str(base64.b64encode(image_file.read()))[2:][:-1] json_data[&quot;xCoord&quot;] = image.xCoord json_data[&quot;yCoord&quot;] = image.yCoord return jsonify(json_data) . If the first procedure locates and selects the image, the second procedure then encodes, formats, and returns the JSON data containing the image and its metadata. . The procedure first calls the get_random_easy_image() procedure created earlier to store our image object and also initializes an empty dictionary to store our json data. . If a valid image object is found, the procedure will attempt to create an absolute path to the image file on the computer running flask application. This is achieved by concatenating the absolute path of the working project directory to the relative image path stored in the database. The aboslute path of the directory is generated in our namespace package (__init__.py) in our _nighthawkguessr_api_ package. The line calculating the project path is shown below, and uses the Path object from the pathlib library. . project_path = Path.cwd().as_posix() . After creating the image path, the procedure attempts to open the image file, and procedes to use the base64.b64encode method to encode the image file bytes into base64 data. This is convinient for us as HTML on the frontend pages allows us to render images with base64 bytes (Not sure about normal image bytes). The base64 bytes are then encoded into a python literal string in order to be jsonified and displayed on the api endpoint. The [2:][:-1] appended to the end is a type of string slicing which removes the b&#39; generated at the start of the data and the &#39; generated at the end of the data. These extraneous characters are used to indicate a base64 string, and are not part of the original data. . The procedure finally appends the metadata (position of the right coordinates on the map) to the json_data dictionary, completing the process. . Finally, the procedure returns the JSONified data, which is accessible from our API. As you can see, the images we process are extremely large and possess high resolution (typically a few megabytes!) . Popcorn Hack: . Please write a few sentences answering the essential question, &quot;What are some methods that we could store and access images in the backend, and how can we send them to a frontend application?&quot; . - . Endpoints . What are endpoints and how do we use them to transfer data from one part of the internet to another? . Backend: . The backend creates endpoints that are used to edit the properties of the database constructed by the model. | ____, ____, ____, and ____ methods are used in order to define HTTP endpoints in the API. These endpoints are based on requests that can be made to __ the database. | Variables defined in the __ file are used to call data from the database in order to be manipulated. | . | . Methods in Backend Example . Modules are being imported with specified classes which are used later in the program. Blueprint: used to organize __ and functions | request: used to access data sent to the Flask app. through the __ request | Api: creates a Flask instance that handles requests | Resource: this allows for the definition of custom HTTP requests | reqparse: used to parse (sort and search) and validate data that is requested | . | The blueprint and api are then defined as variables and are used to store any future data that is requested. | Some preliminary functions, such as find_by_username, are created to be used later in the API code, allowing for __ code. In this case, these functions are used to search through the database to find specific usernames. | . | . from flask import Blueprint, request from flask_restful import Api, Resource, reqparse # setting variables used to store future data leaderboard_bp = Blueprint(&quot;leaderboards&quot;, __name__) leaderboard_api = Api(leaderboard_bp) # pre-made function created to search for usernames, allows for simplified program def find_by_username(username): users = Leaderboard.query.filter_by(_username=username).all() return users[0] . GET Method . This method is used to __ specific data points from the database by searching through the usernames. | This will be different for each type of database being made, however the general format stays the same. Since this is a text database, to pull specific information from the database, the API will __ through the data using the username, which is unique. | The function defined previously, find_by_username(), is used to search through the database and pull the specific data point that is being searched. | If the user exists, the data of that user will be returned, being sent to the __ of the program. | If a user isn&#39;t found, an error will be returned that the user does not exist. | . | In general, the program will always be searching for a piece of information that is unique and that will be used to pull data to wherever it is being requested. | . def get(self): # requested username turned into variable for later use username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) # username used to search for data and the found data is made into a variable user = find_by_username(username) if user: # data is sent to the frontend return user.to_dict() # error checking return {&quot;message&quot;: user}, 404 . POST Method . This method is used to __ a specific piece of information in the database based on searching by usernames. | This is again different for each database that is made, however the general structure stays the same. In this example, a parser is being used to extract data from an incoming __. In this case, the RequestParser class is used from the Flask module. All required arguments are added to the parser, specifying what type of data it is. | The ____ variable is added in order to parse and store all incoming data. | . | The variable leaderboard is created to make a new object that will contain the values from the incoming data. | The function will attempt to add a new entry in the leaderboard database and return a status of a successful addition of the data. | If there is an error in the data being inputted, a status code of __ will be returned. | . | . def post(self): # using parsers to gather and data that is to be posted and validate it&#39;s true parser = reqparse.RequestParser() parser.add_argument(&quot;username&quot;, required=True, type=str) parser.add_argument(&quot;password&quot;, required=True, type=str) parser.add_argument(&quot;pointsEasy&quot;, required=True, type=int) parser.add_argument(&quot;pointsMedium&quot;, required=True, type=int) parser.add_argument(&quot;pointsHard&quot;, required=True, type=int) # variable made to store data args = parser.parse_args() # variable created to format all data into one place and send to database for logging leaderboard = Leaderboard(args[&quot;username&quot;], args[&quot;password&quot;], args[&quot;pointsEasy&quot;], args[&quot;pointsMedium&quot;], args[&quot;pointsHard&quot;]) try: # data is sent to the database for storage db.session.add(leaderboard) db.session.commit() return leaderboard.to_dict(), 201 except Exception as e: # error checking db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . PUT Method . This method is used to __ a specific piece of information in the database based on searching by usernames. | For each data base that is made, there will be different specific but the overall structure stays the same. First, the username variable is defined, which __ the requested username and sets it as a variable that will be used later to edit a specific dataset. | The function find_by_username() is again used to search through the data to look for the username requested. This is set to a variable to be used later. | If the username is found in the database, the rest of the dataset is updated with the new __ requested. This is updated into the database. | If there is an error found with the data requested of it the user isn&#39;t found, an error is returned. | . | . def put(self): # variable created to make requested username into something that can be used to search for data in future username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) try: # attempts to find the data in the database user = find_by_username(username) if user: # if the data is found, the data points are updates user.pointsEasy = int(request.get_json().get(&quot;pointsEasy&quot;)) user.pointsMedium = int(request.get_json().get(&quot;pointsMedium&quot;)) user.pointsHard = int(request.get_json().get(&quot;pointsHard&quot;)) db.session.commit() return user.to_dict(), 201 else: # if user not found, error is returned return {&quot;message&quot;: &quot;leaderboard not found&quot;}, 404 except Exception as e: # checks for errors in request db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . DELETE Method . This method is used to __ a specific information from the database, again searching by username. | The overall structure stays the same between different databases, but the specific __ will need to be changed to personalize the database. A variable for the username is created in order to search for for the user name requested later in the code with the function find_by_username(). | If the user is found, the user is deleted, along with that user&#39;s data and the change is saved to the database. | If the user isn&#39;t found or if an error is found with the data requested, an __ is returned. | . | . def delete(self): # username variable defined to store requested value username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) try: # finds the username and stores data in variable user = find_by_username(username) if user: # if the user is found, the user and their data is deleted db.session.delete(user) db.session.commit() return user.to_dict() else: # if user not found, error is returned return {&quot;message&quot;: &quot;leaderboard not found&quot;}, 404 except Exception as e: # error checking for request error db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . Displaying the Full Database . Another class is created in order to __ the entire database at once and also to delete the entire database if necessary. | This uses the same functions as before to GET and DELETE the data, however it is modified slightly to look through the entire database abd display or delete all data points. | An example of where this would be useful is to create a table of data in the __. | . class LeaderboardListAPI(Resource): # GET method def get(self): try: # attempts to find the entire database requested and is stored in variable leaderboards = db.session.query(Leaderboard).all() # sends back the entire database return [leaderboard.to_dict() for leaderboard in leaderboards] except Exception as e: # error checking for request errors db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 # DELETE method def delete(self): try: # deletes entire database db.session.query(Leaderboard).delete() db.session.commit() return [] except Exception as e: # checks for errors in request db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 .

In order to print the data, the function getList() is run and once it is run, it __ through the data to pull out each individual data point and enter it into the function used to make the table. For each class in the database, which is each row in the database, the variables corresponding to that specific class are pulled and inserted into the addTask() function as __ to create the table of users. | . | The function addTask() is used to create the visual table that the user sees. A row is created and for each table cell in that row, the data is added by iterating through the __ of variables that are parameters pulled directly from the database. | A new row is added into table for each new class of information pulled from the database. | . | . // fetches entire database const getList = async () =&gt; { // stores it in variable list const list = await fetch(api + &quot;/leaderboardList&quot;).then((r) =&gt; r.json()); return list }; // goes through entire database and pulls each individual class getList().then(list =&gt; { // for each class (row), data is pulled and added into addTask() function to be put in visual table list.forEach(cls =&gt; { addTask(cls.username, cls.pointsEasy, cls.pointsMedium, cls.pointsHard) }) }) // adds visual representation of data in table function addTask(username, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard) { // array of variables defining data points var tableCells = [username, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard] // creates new row in variable var row = document.createElement(&#39;tr&#39;) // goes through entire data set and places data into cells for (var i = 0; i &lt; tableCells.length; i++) { var tableCell = document.createElement(&#39;th&#39;) tableCell.textContent = tableCells[i] tableCell.className = &#39;cell&#39; row.appendChild(tableCell) } // creates new row as child of schedule element schedule.appendChild(row) } . POST Method . This method is used to push data to the backend using the __ POST method. The function addData is defined with the parameters that are going to be pushed into the backend. | An object is created to define the variables that are going to be pushed into the backend. This is basically the __ string that will be sent to the backend to get decoded and inserted into the database. | The fetch() function is called with the api variable, which is a variable representing the url for the backend API, and the extension specific to where the data will be posted, in this case being /leaderboard. The method, __, and body of the data are defined in order to complete a successful HTTP request to the backend. The object data which was created earlier, is converted to a JSON string here and sent to the backend. | . | If an error is detected, it is returned and the request will fail. | . | . // calls addData function function addData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // creates object defining the variables that will be added to the backend, corresponding with the backend variables let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // POST method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;POST&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . PUT and DELETE Methods . These two methods are almost identical to the POST method above in the way they work, the only difference being that the __ requested is different. The name of the function defined is also changes, in this case being editData() and deleteData(). | . // editing function defined function editData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // has object with variables that are required in backend let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // PUT method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;PUT&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . // deleting function defined function deleteData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // object defined with variables that are same as backend let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // DELETE method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;DELETE&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . Calling Images (GET Method) . The process for calling images is basically the same as anything else, except you need to be able to reconstruct the images based on the __ that is requested from the backend. | In this case, the image in the api is being called to the frontend and is returned as the variable list. This is then inserted directly into the html by getting the element that needs to be edited and styling with __ by using the built-in function data:image/png;base64, which translated from bytes to pixel. | . | . // GET method calling info from backend url const getList = async () =&gt; { const list = await fetch(api + &quot;/api/images/GetEasyImage&quot;).then((r) =&gt; r.json()); return list }; // inserting image into frontend getList().then(list =&gt; { document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;body&quot;)[0].style = &quot;background-image: url(&#39;data:image/png;base64, &quot; + list.bytes +&quot;&#39;);&quot; }) .

(mention JSON in your answer) | Time and Space Complexity of Algorithms . The lesson for time and space complexity of algorithms will consist of demonstrations of sorting algorithms and the different time complexities that they come with on a small scale. This can be acomplished using things such as a deck of cards or even with actual people. An example of how this will work is laying out the cards in a random order on the table, and demonstrating different ways of sorting it. From methods such as bubble sort to methods such as bogo sort, it will be really easy to see exactly how much time it would take for these different sorting algoritms to complete. Then after that, it is easy to understand the concept of time complexity when given a real world example. . Space complexity can be demonstrated by using the same method, however, adding in the extra step of having the cards in a pile. This will show how much space is needed to complete the sorting algorithm. This will easily reveal the concept of space complexity because it allows people to witness a real world, physical example of the concept, turning a really hard to grasp concept into something that is easy to understand. . Additionally, we are also going to analyze certain algorithms within our project to show how such analysis is applicable to real world projects. . Essential Question: What is the quicksort algorithm, and how does it work? How does it&#39;s time and space complexities scale with input sizes? . QuickSort Algorithm . The main algorithm we&#39;ve employed is an recursive implementation of quickSort in the backend to sort the database entries to obtain the user with the highest overall score. Typically this algorithm is implemented to sort in ascending order, but to make it easier to extract the top 10 users, we sill be modifying the algorithm to sort in descending order (so the top players show up first in the list). . class LeaderboardTop10(Resource): def partition(self, arr, lo, hi): pivot = arr[hi][1] # Pivot value set to the 2nd index of the last element pivot_pos = lo - 1 # Set our base pivot position, ensure that lower picoit index == lo for idx in range(lo, hi): # Iterate over all elements in the partition array if arr[idx][1] &gt;= pivot: # Found an element creater than pivot pivot_pos+=1 # Increment correct position for pivot arr[pivot_pos], arr[idx] = arr[idx], arr[pivot_pos] # Swap the larger element with the element at the current pivot position arr[pivot_pos + 1], arr[hi] = arr[hi], arr[pivot_pos + 1] # Swap element at pivot position with the pivot element return pivot_pos+1 # Return index of pivot element def qSortUserList(self, arr, lo, hi): if lo &lt; hi: last_pivot = self.partition(arr, lo, hi) self.qSortUserList(arr, lo, last_pivot-1) self.qSortUserList(arr, last_pivot+1, hi) def get(self): users_list = get_user_list() top10 = {} self.qSortUserList(users_list, 0, len(users_list)-1) for user in users_list: top10[user[0]] = user[1] print(top10) if len(top10) &lt;= 10: return top10 return top10[:10] . To understand how the algorithm first, we must first familiarize ourselves with the process. . Our backend grabs all users from our leaderboard | Returns all users and their scores in a 2-D array, each element is a list of length two that contains the username and cumulative score of the player | The sorting algorithm will use the second element representing the user score to sort the array of users. ┌─────────────────────┐ ┌──────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ Split │ │ display │ │ Database │ │ the ├──────────────► sorted list │ │ │ │ List into │ │ on endpoint │ │ │ │ top 10 users │ │ │ └──────────┬──────────┘ └─────────▲────────┘ └─────────────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ┌──────────▼──────────┐ ┌─────────┴────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ 2-D User Array │ │ QuickSort │ │ ├───────────────► │ │ [(username, score)] │ │ Algorithm │ │ │ │ │ └─────────────────────┘ └──────────────────┘ . Our quickSort algorithm consists of 2 procedures, a partition() procedure that pivots and sorts individual elements, and a qSortUserList() that performs recursion which finishes the sorting. | The Logic . The partition procedure will serve to &quot;partition&quot; our list into 2 parts, a smaller portion and a larger portion around a certain pivot value (Note: These portions don&#39;t have to sorted yet!). . Partition procedure . First, partition selects a certain element in a list to be a ___. This pivot value will be used to make comparisons to every other value in the array. For simplicity, we have selected our pivot element as the last element in the unsorted list. The procedure defines a pivot_pos variable to denote the correct position of the pivot index after each iteration. Although it may seem weird that the variable intially starts with a value of 0-1 = -1, this negative index is resolved by the return statement, which always returns an index that&#39;s one higher than pivot_pos. This serves to ensure that the lowest pivot index would be 0, which is the smallest element in any given partition. . pivot = arr[hi][1] pivot_pos = lo - 1 . The partition will then iterate over each element in the list from the starting and ending indexes indicated by the parameters. if a particular value is found to be larger than the pivot, the algorithm well then increment the recorded pivot position and swap the pivot with the found element. . for idx in range(lo, hi): if arr[idx][1] &gt;= pivot: pivot_pos+=1 arr[pivot_pos], arr[idx] = arr[idx], arr[pivot_pos] . Finally, the partition procedure swaps the element at the pivot_pos+1 index with our pivot element at the hi index to place the pivot at it&#39;s rightful place. We know that pivot_pos+1 must be smaller than hi because it did not trigger the conditional to increment the `pivot_pos+1`` index. At last, the pivot_pos is incremented and returned to serve as an indicator of where our two partitions split. . arr[pivot_pos + 1], arr[hi] = arr[hi], arr[pivot_pos + 1] return pivot_pos+1 . qSort procedure . If the parition procedure splits our list into smaller and larger regions, then our qSort procedure ensures that these regions are in order. It&#39;s hard to explain, but the procedure iterates over each paritition, repeating the paritition process, setting new pivot values, and correctly places the pivot values at their correct sorted order. . The procedure first checks if the lower index is smaller than the higher index, to ensure that our parition has a length greater than 1. If this check passes, the procedure then calls the partition procedure to both split our list into the two distinct regions and also the index of our correctly placed pivot value. The procedure then invokes itself again on the larger interval (replacing hi to be the partition index-1 since the previous pivot is already sorted), and also on the smaller interval (replacing lo to be partition index+1). . Eventually, the qSort procedure will iterate through all elements in the list while parition places each element at the correct position, giving us the final sorted list. . Complexity analysis . To analyze time complexity, we must analyze the partition and qSort procedures. . For the qSort procedure, because we divide the array into 2 halves during each function call, our number of function calls scales proportionally to ___, where ___ is the length of the input array. However, within each function call, we also call the partition procedure, which contains an for-loop that iterates over each element in the partioned array, comparing it to a pivot value. We are well familiar with since loops, and can safely say that runtime scales proportionally to the length of the partition array. Due to this, we can conclude that our iteration time complexity scales ___. Thus for each iterative process, our timerun scales proportionally to ___. . Finally, we could multiply our two complexities together to get a representation of our overall complexity. Thus, the asymptotic notation for a time complexity could be represented as _, where n is the length of the input array. Keep in mind, Big-Oh notation is not a function that returns the accurate runtime for any given input, but rather only gives us a model to see how runtime scales with increasing input sizes. . Space complexity for this program is much easier to analyze. Because the array is sorted in-place (meaning we don&#39;t create other placeholders or copies), we require no additional space to sort this array. However, recursive function calls may require extra storage on the call stack. Since we found the number of recursive calls to be asymptotic to _, we can conclude that quickSort has an O(1) space complexity for an iterative method, and an O(logn) space complexity for a recursive method. .

            "title": "Big Idea 2 - Data Related to User Guide",
            "content": "Introduction . When building an application that requires users to create accounts or sign in, handling data related to users is crucial. This data can include things like user profiles, preferences, and activity logs, which can be used to personalize the user experience and optomize the application&#39;s performance. . By learning how to handle data related to users effectively and efficiently, you&#39;ll be equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to build helpful applications that meet the needs of your users. . PLEASE DON&#39;T OPEN THE POPCORN HACKS, WE WILL OPEN THEM DURING THE PRESENTATION . Basics of Class and User Data . Establishing Class/User Data and making a new user . Because Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, everything in it represents an object. Lists, dictionaries, functions, etc. are all examples of Python objects. Generally speaking, a Python object is an entity of data items items and methods describing the behavior of those items. . A Python class is a template used to create Python objects. We can think of it as a cooking recipe, where all the ingredients and their quantities are listed, and the whole process of cooking is described step-by-step. . In this case, we can compare a cake recipe to a class, and a cake cooked following that recipe to an object (i.e., an instance of that class). Using the same recipe (class), we can create many cakes (objects). This is the essence of creating a class in Python: to define data elements and the rules establishing how these elements can interact and change their state — and then use this framework to build various objects in a set way, instead of creating them from scratch every time. . Let&#39;s look at a few examples: . class Bikes: name = &quot;&quot; gear = 0 # create objects of class bike1 = Bikes() # objectName = ClassName() bike2 = Bikes() . Now that we have our class and object defined, we can now run code to modify certain attributes of our objects. . bike1.gear = 11 bike1.name = &quot;Mountain Bike&quot; bike2.gear = 13 bike2.name = &quot;Road Bike&quot; print(f&quot;Name: {bike1.name}, Gears: {bike1.gear} &quot;) . Name: Mountain Bike, Gears: 11 . Popcorn Hacks #1: Add another print command to display the attributes of Bike #2. What output will this code segment produce? print(f&quot;Name: {bike2.name}, Gears: {bike2.gear} &quot;) . Name: Road Bike, Gears: 13 . Example: Defining a User Class . Now we will look into Classes for users of a program or website. . class User: def __init__(self, username, email): self.username = username self.email = email def display_info(self): print(f&quot;Username: {self.username}, Email: {self.email}&quot;) . For this cell, we define a User class with a constructor method &quot;init&quot; that takes username and email as parameters. The display_info method is used to print the user information. . For backend functionality, this class can be used to create, manipulate, and manage user data. For example, when a new user signs up for an account, you could create a new User object with their username and email. This object can then be used to perform various operations, such as validating the user&#39;s input, storing the user&#39;s data in a database, or processing user-related requests. . Now let&#39;s make a new User: . new_user = User(&quot;jeffrey&quot;, &quot;leejeffreysc@gmail.com&quot;) new_user.display_info() . Username: jeffrey, Email: leejeffreysc@gmail.com . Here&#39;s a step-by-step breakdown of how the code relates to backend functionality: . new_user = User(&quot;jeffrey&quot;, &quot;leejeffreysc@gmail.com&quot;): This line creates a new User object, initializing it with the username &quot;jeffrey&quot; and the email &quot;leejeffreysc@gmail.com&quot;. This could represent a user who has just signed up for an account, and the input values would typically come from user input, such as a frontend signup form. . new_user.display_info(): This line calls the display_info method on the new_user object, which prints the user&#39;s information (username and email) to the console. In a real-world backend application, you might use this method or a similar one to display user information in logs, send a welcome email, or create an API response with the user&#39;s data. . User/Class @ Decorators: . A Python Class allows for the use of @ decorators, these allow access to attribute data without the use of functions. . @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to &quot;GET&quot; attribute data in a clean method (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to &quot;UPDATE&quot;/set attribute data in a clean method (object.name = &quot;Jeffrey&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;Jeffrey&quot;)) | . The getter and setter methods provide a clean and controlled way to access and modify the attributes of an object. This can be particularly useful when interacting with databases, APIs, or other parts of a web application that require the management and manipulation of object attributes. . class Student: def __init__(self, student, name): self._student = student self._name = name @property def name(self): return self._name @name.setter def name(self, new_name): self._name = new_name . In this example, the Student class has a name attribute, which is accessed and modified through the name property getter and setter methods. The _name attribute uses an underscore prefix, which is a convention to indicate it should not be accessed directly. . Usage of the getter and setter methods are below: . student = Student(1001, &quot;Derek Sol&quot;) print(student.name) # Get the name using the getter method student.name = &quot;Jagger Klein&quot; # Set the name using the setter method print(student.name) . Derek Sol Jagger Klein . Popcorn Hacks #2: The following code segment for computers does not have getter and setter methods called. Using the missing attributes &quot;model&quot; and &quot;year&quot;, add example getter and setters methods for this class. Show us an example output that this code segment might produce. class Computer: def __init__(self, model, year): self._model = model self._year = year @property def model(self): return self._model @model.setter def model(self, new_model): self._model = new_model @property def year(self): return self._year @year.setter def year(self, new_year): self._year = new_year . my_computer = Computer(&quot;Macbook Pro&quot;, 2020) print(&quot;Model:&quot;, my_computer.model) print(&quot;Year:&quot;, my_computer.year) . Model: Macbook Pro Year: 2020 . Databases and SQLite . A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, manipulation, and management of that data. In other words, a database is a software application that allows you to store and manage large amounts of data in an organized manner. . Some Examples of Databases: . Storing and managing customer data, such as contact information, order history, and customer preferences. | Keeping track of inventory levels and stock movements in a warehouse or retail store. | Managing financial transactions, such as payments, invoices, and receipts. | . SQLite is a software library that provides a user-friendly database management system. Unlike other databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite is programmed within an application, which means it does not require a separate server process to operate. This makes SQLite great for web applications or for use in situations where you don&#39;t need a full database server. . In this lesson, we will be demonstrating how to set up a SQLite database in Flask, a Python web framework. Flask allows programmers to easily interact with SQLite databases, and we&#39;ll walk through the process of setting up a new database, creating tables, and adding data. We&#39;ll also cover some basic SQL commands that you can use to interact with your database, including CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. . Setting up a SQLite database in Flask . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE students (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, grade INTEGER)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . Note: This will create a new file &#39;database.db&#39; in the _notebooks folder if one doesn&#39;t exist. . Breaking down this code segment: . We imported the necessary libraries and tools | We created a Flask application | We connected to the SQLite database using SQLite3 | We created a cursor object to execute SQL commands | We created tables in the database using SQL commands | . Flask provides several extensions and tools for working with SQLite databases, including Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-SQLite3, and Flask-Admin. These tools provide a high-level interface for interacting with the database, making it easy to perform common operations such as adding, updating, and deleting records. . CRUD Commands with SQLite . CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the basic operations you can perform on data. SQL is useful library because it allows programmers to create new tables to organize data, add new data to a table, update data that&#39;s already there, or delete data that&#39;s no longer needed. . C: To create a new record in a database, you must first define the table structure that will store the data. This can be accomplished using SQL commands such as CREATE. Once the table is created, data can be added to it using the INSERT INTO command. . | R: To retrieve data from the database, you can use the READ command. You can specify which fields you want to retrieve and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. There are also several functions available to aggregate and manipulate data. . | U: To modify existing data in the database, you can use the UPDATE command. You will need to specify which table and fields you want to update, and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. . | D: To remove data from the database, you can use the DELETE command. . | . Example of CRUD within an SQLite Database . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE basketball (_player TEXT PRIMARY KEY, _team TEXT, _position TEXT, _opinion TEXT)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . Hypothetically, our programmer wanted to create an application about basketball players, and created a new table in SQL to store and interact with user-submitted data. Using the same method as the previous table, a new table &#39;basketball&#39; is created by the cursor and added to the &#39;database.db&#39; file. . Create Function: . def create(): database = &#39;database.db&#39; player = input(&quot;Enter the player name&quot;) team = input(&quot;Enter team name&quot;) position = input(&quot;Enter player position&quot;) opinion = input(&quot;Enter your opinion &quot;) # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Execute SQL to insert record in to db cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO basketball (_player, _team, _position, _opinion) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (player, team, position, opinion)) # Commit the changes connection.commit() print(f&quot;New basketball with {player} is added.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while inserting record&quot;, error) # Closing cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() create() . New basketball with Kobe is added. . The create() feature allows users to input information about a basketball player and store it in a SQLite table &#39;basketball&#39; inside the database file we already created &#39;database.db&#39;. The code prompts the user for the player&#39;s name, team name, position, and their opinion about the player, then establishes a connection to the SQLite database and creates a cursor object for executing SQL commands. . The cursor.execute() method is called with an SQL INSERT command to insert a new entry into the &#39;basketball&#39; table. The connection.commit() method saves the changes to the database, and if the record is inserted successfully, a confirmation message is printed. In case of errors, the except block catches the sqlite3.Error exception and prints an error message. Finally, the cursor and the connection to the database are closed, and the create() function is called to execute the code. . Read Function: . def read(): database = &#39;basketball.db&#39; # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() # Fetch all the records from basketball table results = cursor.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM basketball&#39;).fetchall() if len(results) != 0: for row in results: print(row) else: print(&quot;No player found.&quot;) # Closing cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() read() . The read() feature retrieves and prints all entries from the &#39;basketball&#39; table in the specified SQLite database. The script establishes a connection to the SQLite database, creates a cursor object for executing SQL commands, and calls the cursor.execute() method with an SQL SELECT command to fetch all the entires from the &#39;basketball&#39; table. The fetchall() method retrieves all the rows returned by the SELECT command and stores them in the results variable. . The code then checks if there are any records in the table and, if so, iterates through each row in the results using a &#39;for loop&#39; and prints the row. If there are no records, the program prints &quot;No player found&quot;. Finally, the cursor and the connection to the database are closed, and the read() function is called to execute the code. . Update Function: . import sqlite3 def update(): database = &#39;database.db&#39; player = input(&quot;Enter a basketball player to update the opinion for:&quot;) opinion = input(&quot;Enter new opinion:&quot;) # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Updating review for the basketball cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE basketball SET _opinion = ?

Review for the basketball is updated to test123 . This update feature updates the opinion for a specific basketball player in an SQLite database. The code defines an update() function, which prompts the user to input the basketball player they want to update and the new opinion for that player. The script connects to the SQLite database, creates a cursor object, and handles any potential errors while executing the SQL command. The cursor.execute() method updates the review in the database for the specified basketball item. . If at least one value is changed, a success message is printed and the changes are committed to the database. Otherwise, a &quot;Player not found.&quot; message is displayed. In the except block, if an error occurs, an error message along with specific error details is printed. Finally, the cursor and connection to the database are closed, and the update() function is called to execute the review update process. . Delete Function . import sqlite3 def delete(): database = &#39;basketball.db&#39; player = input(&quot;Enter basketball player to delete&quot;) # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM basketball WHERE _player = ?&quot;, (player,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: print(f&quot;{player} does not exist&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Successfully deleted basketball player {player}&quot;) connection.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error occurred: &quot;, error) # Closing cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() delete() . Error occurred: no such table: basketball . The delete feature deletes a specific basketball player from the specified SQLite database. The code defines a delete() function that prompts the user to input the basketball player they want to delete. After connecting to the SQLite database and creating a cursor object, the code handles potential errors while executing the SQL command. The cursor.execute() method is used to delete the basketball item with the specified ID. . If no rows are affected, a message is printed indicating that the basketball player does not exist. Otherwise, a success message is displayed, confirming the basketball player&#39;s deletion. The changes are then committed to the database. In the except block, any error that occurs triggers an error message along with specific error details. Finally, the cursor and connection to the database are closed, and the delete() function is called to execute the basketball item deletion process. This code showcases a practical way to remove information from an SQLite database based on user input. . Menu Functions: . Alongside the four CRUD functions, a menu function is designed to manage Create, Read, Update, Delete operations and display the schema. The menu function is responsible for taking in user inputs and making the program call various functions. When running a menu function, users enter their desired operation, whether it be Create, Read, Update, or Delete, and the input is checked by various conditions to determine which function should be called. Many menu functions are called recursively, so the cell will repeat the menu process until the user decides to exit. . Popcorn Hacks #3: The menu function below is missing some of the CRUD functions for the specified basketball players table. Fix the following code by adding the intended CRUD functions, then perform a READ function on the database. def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . Image Uploading with SQLite . Using various Python Libraries, we are able to upload and customize images using python code, as well as using images to interact with databases. . One way to store images in a database is to INSERT the image data as a binary blob. . To store an image as a blob in SQLite, you can first read the image file and convert it to a binary format using a programming language like Python. Here&#39;s an example of how to do this: . Making the Table to store our Image Data: . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;hacksIMGdatabase.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE images (name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, data BLOB)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . We use a new data type &quot;BLOB&quot; to store specific data from our .jpg image. . Adding Image Data to our Table: . You can use this example sunset jpg for our code. Download and place it in the same repository as this notebook. Rename image to &#39;image.jpg&#39; . https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/01/04/78/75/360_F_104787586_63vz1PkylLEfSfZ08dqTnqJqlqdq0eXx.jpg . import sqlite3 # Open a connection to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;hacksIMGdatabase.db&#39;) # Read the image file as binary data with open(&#39;images/kanye.jpg&#39;, &#39;rb&#39;) as jpg: image_data = jpg.read() # Insert the image data into the database conn.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO images (name, data) VALUES (?, ?)&quot;, (&#39;image&#39;, image_data)) # Commit the transaction conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . In this example, the image data is read from the &quot;image.jpg&quot; file and inserted into the &quot;images&quot; table in the &quot;database.db&quot; SQLite database. The image data is then stored as a binary blob in the &quot;data&quot; column of the table. . Converting BLOB to Image -&gt; Displaying Image . import sqlite3 from PIL import Image import io # Open a connection to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;hacksIMGdatabase.db&#39;) # Retrieve the image data from the database result = conn.execute(&quot;SELECT data FROM images WHERE name=?&quot;, (&#39;image&#39;,)).fetchone() # Convert the binary data to an image object image_data = io.BytesIO(result[0]) image = Image.open(image_data) # Display the image image.show() # Close the connection conn.close() . The image data is then retrieved from the &quot;images&quot; table using a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause that correctly matches the image name. The binary image data is then converted to an image object using the PIL library and displayed on the screen. . Popcorn Hacks #4: Using the same table, find a new .jpg image and add its image data to the database. Display the image using the PIL Library and show us the output image. import sqlite3 from PIL import Image import io # Open a connection to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;hacksIMGdatabase.db&#39;) # Read the image file as binary data with open(&#39;images/kanye.jpg&#39;, &#39;rb&#39;) as png: image_data = png.read() # Insert the image data into the database conn.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO images (name, data) VALUES (?, ?)&quot;, (&#39;mtfuji&#39;, image_data)) # Commit the transaction conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() # Open a connection to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;hacksIMGdatabase.db&#39;) # Retrieve the image data from the database result = conn.execute(&quot;SELECT data FROM images WHERE name=?&quot;, (&#39;mtfuji&#39;,)).fetchone() # Convert the binary data to an image object image_data = io.BytesIO(result[0]) image = Image.open(image_data) # Display the image image.show() # Close the connection conn.close() .

Understand how computers can be used to represent real-world phenomena or outcomes | Compare simulations with real-world contexts. | Implement code to mimic real world situations, problems, or phenomena. | What are simulations by College Board definition? . Simulations are programs that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real world Purposes include drawing inferences without the consequences of the real world | . | Simulations use varying sets of values to reflect the hypothetical state of a real phenomenon | Often, when developing a simulation, it is necessary to remove specific problems or simplify aspects Simulations can often contain bias based on which details or real-world elements were included/excluded | . | Simulations allow the formulation of predictions under consideration | Variability and randomness of the world is considered using random number generators | Examples: rolling dice, spinners, molecular models, analyze chemicals/reactions.. | . . Analyzing an Example: Air-Traffic Simulator . Say we want to find out what the optimal number of aircrafts that can be in the air in one area is. | A simulation allows us to explore this question without real world contraints of money, time, safety Unfortunately we can&#39;t just fly 67 planes all at once and see what happens | . | Since the simulation won&#39;t be able to take all variables into control, it may have a bias towards one answer | Will not always have the same result | .

Question: The following code simulates the feeding of 4 fish in an aquarium while the owner is on a 5-day trip: . numFish ← 4 foodPerDay ← 20 foodLeft ← 160 daysStarving ← 0 REPEAT 5 TIMES { foodConsumed ← numFish * foodPerDay foodLeft ← foodLeft - foodConsumed IF (foodLeft &lt; 0) { daysStarving ← daysStarving + 1 } . } . This simulation simplifies a real-world scenario into something that can be modeled in code and executed on a computer. | Summarize how the code works: | . In the code, you created a variable that stores the number of fish, food given per day, food left, and lastly a counter for days starving. Then you created a loop that repeats 5 times simulation 5 days. The number of food consumed is the number of fish (4) * 20 (food per day) which gets subtracted from the total food left. After that you just have a simple if check that checks if there is no food left, and adds a day. . Examples .

Binary is Base 2, meaning each digit can only represent values of 0 and 1. | Decimal is Base 10, meaning eacht digit can represent values from 0 to 9. | Conversion between sequences of binary to decimal depend on how many binary numbers there are, their values and their positions. | . Practice Questions: . What values can each digit of a Base 5 system represent? The value a 5 digit based system can represent is 5^n depending on where it correlates to then the prior values can be added to each other to be able to get the total value of the number as for instance 001001 can be represent as (0 x 2^6) + (0 x 2^6) + (1 x 2^5) ... and how a similar concept can be used in a base 10 system we could do the exact same thing with a base 5 system. . | What base is Hexadecimal? What range of values can each digit of Hexadecimal represent? Hexadecimals are base 16. This can range from 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f . | When using a base above 10, letters can be used to represent numbers past 9. These letters start from A and continue onwards. For example, the decimal number 10 is represented by the letter A in Hexadecimal. What letter would be used to represent the Base 10 number 23 in a Base 30 system? What about in a Base 50 system? In a base system above 10, letters are used to represent numbers past 9. To find the letter that represents a particular number in a given base system, we perform integer division and modulus operations. For example, to represent the number 23 in a base 30 system, we divide 23 by 30 and take the remainder, which is 23. The corresponding letter for the number 23 in base 30 is H, so 23 in base 30 is represented as the single digit H. Similarly, to represent the number 23 in a base 50 system, we divide 23 by 50 and take the remainder, which is 23. The corresponding letter for the number 23 in base 50 is X, so 23 in base 50 is represented as the single digit X. #### Examples . | Using 6 bits, we can represent 64 numbers, from 0 to 63, as 2^6 = 64. | The numbers in a sequence of binary go from right to left, increasing by powers of two from 0 to the total amount of bits. The whole number represented is the sum of these bits.

            "title": "Mixins in SASS",
            "content": "SASS is a CSS preprocessor that extends the functionality of CSS by adding features like variables, nesting, and mixins. Mixins are an important feature of SASS that allow you to define reusable pieces of CSS code that can be included in different parts of your code. In this lesson, we&#39;ll take a closer look at mixins in SASS and learn how to use them. . What are Mixins? . In SASS, mixins are a way to define a set of CSS rules that can be reused in different parts of your code. Mixins are defined using the @mixin directive, followed by a name and a set of CSS rules. Here&#39;s an example of a simple mixin: . @mixin box-shadow($shadow) { box-shadow: $shadow; } . This mixin defines a set of CSS rules for a box shadow, and takes a parameter $shadow that can be used to customize the shadow. . Using Mixins . To use a mixin in your code, you can include it using the @include directive, followed by the name of the mixin. Here&#39;s an example: . .button { @include box-shadow(0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)); } . This will add a box shadow to the .button element using the rules defined in the box-shadow mixin. . Mixins with Arguments . Mixins can also take arguments, which allow you to customize the rules defined in the mixin. Here&#39;s an example of a mixin that takes two arguments: . @mixin gradient($start, $end) { background: linear-gradient(to bottom, $start, $end); } . This mixin defines a set of CSS rules for a gradient, and takes two parameters: $start and $end, which are used to define the start and end colors of the gradient. . To use this mixin, you can pass the arguments when you include the mixin, like this: . .header { @include gradient(#FF0000, #00FF00); } . This will add a gradient background to the .header element, using the start color #FF0000 and the end color #00FF00. . Conclusion . Mixins are a powerful feature of SASS that allow you to define reusable pieces of CSS code that can be included in different parts of your code. By using mixins, you can write less code and make your CSS more modular and maintainable. With the ability to take arguments, mixins become even more powerful, allowing you to create highly customizable pieces of CSS code. .",

            "content": "SASS functions . Sass Functions allow you to define complex calculations and transformations that can be used throughout your stylesheet. . What are SASS functions? . Functions are a powerful feature in SASS that allow you to perform complex operations on values, manipulate data, and generate content dynamically. SASS functions can be used to perform arithmetic operations, manipulate colors, work with strings, and more. . Functions in SASS are similar to functions in programming languages, but they can be used within SASS stylesheets to generate CSS code dynamically. . Using Built-in Functions . SASS provides a variety of built-in functions that you can use to perform operations like math, color manipulation, string manipulation, and more. Here are some examples of built-in functions and how to use them. . Math Functions . SASS provides a number of math functions that allow you to perform arithmetic operations on values. Here are some examples: . .round(1.2); // returns 1 .ceil(1.2); // returns 2 .floor(1.2); // returns 1 .abs(-1.2); // returns 1.2 .min(1, 2, 3); // returns 1 .max(1, 2, 3); // returns 3 .random(1, 100); // returns a random number between 1 and 100 . Color Functions . SASS provides a variety of color functions that allow you to manipulate colors. Here are some examples: . .lighten(#007fff, 20%); // returns a lighter shade of blue .darken(#007fff, 20%); // returns a darker shade of blue .opacify(#007fff, 0.2); // makes the color more opaque .transparentize(#007fff, 0.2); // makes the color more transparent .mix(#007fff, #ff0000, 50%); // returns a mix of two colors . String Functions . SASS provides a variety of string functions that allow you to manipulate strings. Here are some examples: . .to-upper-case(&quot;hello world&quot;); // returns &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot; .to-lower-case(&quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;); // returns &quot;hello world&quot; .str-index(&quot;hello world&quot;, &quot;world&quot;); // returns the index of the first occurrence of &quot;world&quot; .str-insert(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot; world&quot;, 5); // inserts &quot; world&quot; into &quot;hello&quot; at position 5 . Creating Custom Functions . In addition to using built-in functions, you can also create your own functions in SASS using the @function directive. Functions take input values, perform calculations, and return a result. Here&#39;s an example of a simple function that calculates the area of a rectangle: . @function rectangle-area($width, $height) { @return $width * $height; } // Usage: $area: rectangle-area(10px, 20px); // Returns 200px . Custom functions can be very powerful, and can be used to create reusable pieces of code that can be used throughout your stylesheets. . Conclusion . SASS functions are a powerful feature that allow you to perform complex operations on values, manipulate data, and generate content dynamically. By using built-in functions and creating your own custom functions, you can greatly extend the capabilities of your SASS stylesheets. .",

The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts.

Yes the network is fault tolerant, as if any link or any points is broken the information can still be distributed to other points in the system. | ii. No the network is not fault tolerant, as if node C goes down, then information can’t be sent to F and thus it is not fault tolerant. | iii. No the network is not fault tolerant, as if node G comes down, then information can’t be sent to A and thus the system cannot be described as fault tolerant. Option C | Option A | The importance of fault tolerance is that there is redundancy in your system and one faulty link doesn’t compromise the entire system and information can still be transmitted throughout the entire system. The internet is an example of such a system as if one link is broken, the information can still be sent through other links while the broken link is being repaired. Thus it is vital to create fault tolerant systems with at least one backup link or node per connection in case of a failure. | | . | . Parallel and Distributed Computing .

Here are some thoughts to add to your story of Computers and Networks… . What is naturally Distributed in Frontend/Backend architecture? In a frontend/backend architecture, the frontend and backend are naturally distributed components. The frontend typically consists of the user interface and presentation layer, while the backend contains the business logic and data storage. The frontend is distributed across multiple devices or clients, such as web browsers, mobile devices, or desktop applications. Each client has its own instance of the frontend code, which communicates with the backend over a network connection. The backend is typically deployed on one or more servers or cloud platforms. The servers may be physically distributed across multiple locations, and the backend may be composed of multiple services or microservices that work together to provide the required functionality. The distributed nature of the frontend/backend architecture allows for scalability, fault tolerance, and performance optimization. The frontend can be scaled by adding more clients or instances, while the backend can be scaled by adding more servers or services. Fault tolerance can be achieved by replicating the backend across multiple servers or locations, and load balancing can be used to optimize performance by distributing the load across multiple servers. Overall, the frontend/backend architecture is a popular and effective way of building modern web applications that can handle large volumes of users and data. | . | Analyze this command in Docker: ENV GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS=&quot;--workers=1 --bind=0.0.0.0:8086&quot;. Determine if there is options are options in this command for parallel computing within the server that runs python/gunicorn. Here is an article The GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS environment variable is used to set command-line arguments for the Gunicorn web server when it starts up. In the provided command, --workers=1 and --bind=0.0.0.0:8086 are specified as arguments. To run the Gunicorn server in parallel, you can increase the number of worker processes to handle multiple requests simultaneously. To do this, simply set the --workers argument to a higher number. For example, if you want to run four worker processes, you can set the argument to --workers=4. It&#39;s important to note that the number of workers you can run at once will depend on the resources available on your system and the workload your application is handling. Be careful not to increase the number of workers beyond what your system can handle, as this can cause performance issues or even crashes. To make sure everything is running smoothly, it&#39;s a good idea to monitor the resource usage of the worker processes while the server is running with multiple workers. You can use tools like htop, top, or systemd to keep an eye on things. In summary, to run the Gunicorn server in parallel, set the --workers argument to a number that your system can handle, and keep an eye on the resource usage of the worker processes to ensure everything stays stable. | . | .

            "title": "Introduction to SASS",
            "content": "What is SASS? . Sass is a preprocessor language that&#39;s interpreted into CSS. A preprocessor language takes input data and converts it to an output that&#39;s used as input by another program. This means when you run Sass code, you&#39;re actually converting your code to CSS. That CSS code output is then used directly by a browser. . Variables . Variables in CSS preprocessors such as Sass allow you to store information that you can reuse in your stylesheet, such as font stacks, colors, or any other CSS value you anticipate needing. The $ symbol is used in Sass to designate a variable. . Below is an example: . Sass . $font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif; $primary-color: #333; body { font: 100% $font-stack; color: $primary-color; } . Css . body { font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333; } . Once Sass is processed, it generates standard CSS by inserting the values we assigned to variables such as $font-stack and $primary-color. This functionality can prove invaluable when dealing with brand colors and ensuring their consistency throughout the website. . Nesting . While composing HTML, you might have observed that it exhibits an explicit nested and visual structure. However, CSS lacks such a hierarchy. On the contrary, Sass allows you to nest your CSS selectors in a manner that aligns with the visual hierarchy of your HTML. Nonetheless, excessive nesting may generate overly qualified CSS, which can be challenging to maintain and is usually considered undesirable.Keeping this in consideration, here&#39;s a sample of common styles for a website&#39;s navigation: . Sass . nav { ul { margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style: none; } li { display: inline-block; } a { display: block; padding: 6px 12px; text-decoration: none; } } . Css . nav ul { margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style: none; } nav li { display: inline-block; } nav a { display: block; padding: 6px 12px; text-decoration: none; } . As you observe, the ul, li, and a selectors are enclosed within the nav selector. This approach is highly beneficial in arranging your CSS and enhancing its readability. . Modules . It is not mandatory to write all of your Sass code in a single file. You can divide it into multiple files as per your preference by utilizing the &quot;@use&quot; rule. This rule imports another Sass file as a module, enabling you to reference its variables, mixins, and functions in your Sass code using a namespace derived from the file name. Additionally, by using a file, the CSS it produces will also be included in the compiled output. . Sass . // _base.scss $font-stack:Helvetica, sans-serif;$primary-color: #333; body { font: 100% $font-stack; color: $primary-color; } . // styles.scss @use &#39;base&#39;; .inverse { background-color: base.$primary-color; color: white; } . Css . body { font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333; } .inverse { background-color: #333; color: white; } . Observe that in the styles.scss file, we are employing &quot;@use &#39;base&#39;;&quot;. If you utilize a file, there&#39;s no requirement to add the file extension. Sass is intelligent enough to comprehend it by itself. .",

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? test . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over othder data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # Only outputs unique numbers # Curly braces indicative of dictionaries # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # No duplicate values . {1, 2, 3} .

            "content": "Score: 40/50 . Question 2: Which of the following is a characteristic of the fault-tolerant nature of routing on the Internet? Correct Answer: The ability to provide data transmission even when some connections have failed. Explanation: This option is correct. Routers on the Internet are able to move packets through various paths to reach their final destination, even when some connections have failed. This characterizes the fault-tolerant nature of routing. . Question 22: An Internet service provider (ISP) is considering an update to its servers that would save copies of the Web pages most frequently visited by each user.Correct Answer: Web sites that are not visited frequently might no longer be accessible to users. Explanation: This option is correct. The actions of the ISP will only affect how frequently visited pages are loaded into Web browsers. Pages not saved by the ISP are still accessed as they were before. . Question 23: Computers are often used to search through large sets of data to find useful patterns in the data. Which of the following tasks is NOT an example where searching for patterns is needed to produce useful information? Correct Answer: A high school analyzing student grades to identify the students with the top ten highest grade point averages. Explanation: This option is correct. By current standards, a single high school’s list of student grades is not considered a large set of data. Furthermore, identifying 10 students with the highest grade point averages is not an example of finding patterns. . Question 32: Some programming languages use constants, which are variables that are initialized at the beginning of a program and never changed. Which of the following are good uses for a constant? Correct Answer: I and III only. Explanation: This option is correct. A constant is a good choice for statement I and statement III because the value of pi and the number of days in a standard calendar week never change. . Question 37: A graphic artist uses a program to draw geometric shapes in a given pattern. The program uses an algorithm that draws the shapes based on input from the artist. The table shows the approximate number of steps the algorithm takes to draw different numbers of shapes. Correct Answer: The algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time because it will use approximately n2. . Question 39: Which of the following CANNOT be displayed as a result of executing the code segment? Correct Answer: 1,3,2,4. Explanation: Correct. In the second iteration of the loop, i is equal to 2. Thus RANDOM(1, i) returns either 1 or 2. So, the output 1 3 2 4 is not possible. . Question 43: A computer science student completes a program and asks a classmate for feedback. The classmate suggests rewriting some of the code to include more procedural abstraction. Which of the following is NOT a benefit of procedural abstraction? Correct Answer: Making the code run faster. Explanation: Correct. Modularity and code reuse do not necessarily lead to faster-running code. . Question 44: Which of the following is a true statement about the student’s use of the computer scientist’s search procedure? Correct Answer: The student is reusing the computer scientist’s procedural abstraction by knowing what the procedure does without knowing how it does it. Explanation: Correct. The student knows that the procedure searches for a value without knowing how it does the searching. This is an example of the use of procedural abstraction. . Question 46: The drawLine procedure is to be used to draw the following figure on a coordinate grid. Correct Answer: B. Explanation: Correct. This code segment draws the three line segments shown in the figure. The first call to drawLine draws a line segment with endpoints (1, 5) and (6, 5). The second call to drawLine draws a line segment with endpoints (1, 5) and (6, 7). The third call to drawLine draws a line segment with endpoints (1, 5) and (6, 3). . Question 47: A time stamp indicates the date and time that a measurement was taken. A data scientist has a list containing 10,000 time stamps, sorted in chronological order. Which of the following is closest to the maximum number of values that will need to be examined when performing a binary search for a value in the list? Correct Answer: B. Explanation: Correct. The binary search algorithm starts at the middle of the list and repeatedly eliminates half the elements until the desired value is found or all the elements have been eliminated. For a list with 10,000 elements, the list will be cut in half a maximum of 13 times, with the total of 14 elements needing to be examined. The list will start with 10,000 elements, then will be reduced to 5,000 elements, then to 2,500 elements, then to 1,250 elements, then to 625 elements, then to 312 elements, then to 156 elements, then to 78 elements, then to 39 elements, then to 19 elements, then to 9 elements, then to 4 elements, then to 2 elements, and then, finally, to 1 element.

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . Space and time complexity are an integral consideration to make about the functionality and running quality of a program. Failing to consider space and time complexity can get in the way of the functionality of the program. Creating bounds for the complexity of a program makes sure that it functions accurately. For example, if time complexity is not considered, then a time-based process that uses the data outputted from a certain long process may fail. | . There&#39;s also a level of convenience for the user to consider. If a program is demanding on a computer and takes a long time to run, people won&#39;t want to use it. | . Take a look at our lassen volcano example from the data compression tech talk. The first code block is the original image. In the second code block, change the baseWidth to rescale the image. . from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: lassen_volcano = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}]) image_display(lassen_volcano) . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path from PIL import Image as pilImage from io import BytesIO import base64 # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 625 #baseWidth = 1250 #baseWidth = 2500 #baseWidth = 5000 # see the effect of doubling or halfing the baseWidth #baseWidth = 10000 #baseWidth = 20000 #baseWidth = 40000 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;width&#39;], image[&#39;height&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;pixels&#39;] = image[&#39;width&#39;] * image[&#39;height&#39;] # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;scaled_width&#39;], image[&#39;scaled_height&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;scaled_pixels&#39;] = image[&#39;scaled_width&#39;] * image[&#39;scaled_height&#39;] # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(image[&#39;pil&#39;], image[&#39;format&#39;]) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # Use numpy to concatenate two arrays images = image_data(images = [{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}]) # Display meta data, scaled view, and grey scale for each image for image in images: image_management(image) print(&quot;- meta data --&quot;) print(image[&#39;label&#39;]) print(image[&#39;source&#39;]) print(image[&#39;format&#39;]) print(image[&#39;mode&#39;]) print(&quot;Original size: &quot;, image[&#39;size&#39;], &quot; pixels: &quot;, f&quot;{image[&#39;pixels&#39;]:,}&quot;) print(&quot;Scaled size: &quot;, image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;], &quot; pixels: &quot;, f&quot;{image[&#39;scaled_pixels&#39;]:,}&quot;) print(&quot;-- original image --&quot;) display(HTML(image[&#39;html&#39;])) . - meta data -- Lassen Volcano Peter Carolin PNG RGBA Original size: (1190, 1628) pixels: 1,937,320 Scaled size: (625, 855) pixels: 534,375 -- original image -- . Do you think this is a time complexity or space complexity or both problem? . I think it&#39;s a problem with both.

Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . 263 Alabama . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . 178 1.78 . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402 403 404 405 406 407 408 409 410 411 412 413 414 415 416 417 418 419 420 421 422 423 424 425 426 427 428 429 430 431 432 433 434 435 436 437 438 439 440 441 442 443 444 445 446 447 448 449 450 451 452 453 454 455 456 457 458 459 460 461 462 463 464 465 466 467 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 485 486 487 488 489 490 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 519 520 521 522 523 524 525 526 527 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 538 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 546 547 548 549 550 551 552 553 554 555 556 557 558 559 560 561 562 563 564 565 566 567 568 569 570 571 572 573 574 575 576 577 578 579 580 581 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589 590 591 592 593 594 595 596 597 598 599 600 601 602 603 604 605 606 607 608 609 610 611 612 613 614 615 616 617 618 619 620 621 622 623 624 625 626 627 628 629 630 631 632 633 634 635 636 637 638 639 640 641 642 643 644 645 646 647 648 649 650 651 652 653 654 655 656 657 658 659 660 661 662 663 664 665 666 667 668 669 670 671 672 673 674 675 676 677 678 679 680 681 682 683 684 685 686 687 688 689 690 691 692 693 694 695 696 697 698 699 700 701 702 703 704 705 706 707 708 709 710 711 712 713 714 715 716 717 718 719 720 721 722 723 724 725 726 727 728 729 730 731 732 733 734 735 736 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830 831 832 833 834 835 836 837 838 839 840 841 842 843 844 845 846 847 848 849 850 851 852 853 854 855 856 857 858 859 860 861 862 863 864 865 866 867 868 869 870 871 872 873 874 875 876 877 878 879 880 881 882 883 884 885 886 887 888 889 890 891 892 893 894 895 896 897 898 899 900 901 902 903 904 905 906 907 908 909 910 911 912 913 914 915 916 917 918 919 920 921 922 923 924 925 926 927 928 929 930 931 932 933 934 935 936 937 938 939 940 941 942 943 944 945 946 947 948 949 950 951 952 953 954 955 956 957 958 959 960 961 962 963 964 965 966 967 968 969 970 971 972 973 974 975 976 977 978 979 980 981 982 983 984 985 986 987 988 989 990 991 992 993 994 995 996 997 998 999 . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) .

Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . [[18, 28], [18, 28]] . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) print(fibonacci(30)) #print(fibonacci(40)) . 832040 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) . [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1], [2, 3], [2], [3], []] . Using the time library, we are able to see the difference in time it takes to calculate the fibonacci function above. . Based on what is known about the other time complexities, hypothesize the resulting elapsed time if the function is replaced. | . The difference in timing between the functions seems to be based upon the mathematical multipliers associated. For example, in the exponential case below, the time will likely be close to double the previous because the product is continuously multipled by 2 for each n. . For logarithmic, the difference in timing would likely be less extreme as time goes on, since logarithm functions grow longer more than they do greater. It makes sense that quadratic gets greater and greater as n increases, for example. . import time start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(34)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(35)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) . 5702887 Time taken: 1.7627229690551758 seconds 9227465 Time taken: 2.9626896381378174 seconds . Hacks . Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms. | Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. | . Complete the Time and Space Complexity analysis questions linked below. Practice . Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? . Time and space complexity are important considerations when choosing an algorithm because they directly impact the efficiency of the algorithm. The time complexity determines how long an algorithm takes to execute, and the space complexity determines how much memory the algorithm uses. For large datasets or real-time applications, it is crucial to choose an algorithm with low time complexity. Similarly, when working with limited memory resources or large datasets, choosing an algorithm with low space complexity is essential to avoid memory issues. | . Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? . No, the choice of an algorithm depends on the specific problem, context, and constraints you are working with. While constant time algorithms are generally more efficient than exponential time algorithms, there are cases where using an exponential time algorithm might be necessary or even preferable | . What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? . Constant time complexity (O(1)): Algorithms that have a constant number of operations, regardless of the input size, exhibit constant time complexity. | Linear time complexity (O(n)): If the number of operations is directly proportional to the input size, the algorithm has linear time complexity. For example, if you iterate through an array or list once, the time complexity is O(n). | Quadratic time complexity (O(n^2)): Algorithms with nested loops that iterate through the input typically exhibit quadratic time complexity. For example, comparing each element of an array to every other element results in O(n^2) complexity. | Logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)): If the algorithm reduces the input size by a factor (usually 2) in each iteration, it has logarithmic time complexity. Binary search is an example, as it divides the search space in half with each step. | . Question 1 . What is the time and space complexity of the following code? . a = 0 b = 0 for i in range(N): a = a + random() for i in range(M): b = b + random() . My answer: 3 . Reasoning: The time complexity of the two for loops is O(N) and O(M) respectively, but since they are not nested, the time complexity cannot be obtained by multiplying N and M. Rather, it would be represented as O(N + M). The size of the variables is constant and independent of the input size, so the space complexity can be expressed as O(1) or linear. . Question 2 . What is the time complexity of the following code? . a = 0 for i in range(N): for j in reversed(range(i,N)): a = a + i + j . My answer: 4 . Reasoning: These for loops are nested, making them a classic example of quadratic time complexity, which we covered in class. Thus, I could quickly determine that their time complexity is O(N*N). . Question 3 . What is the time complexity of the following code? . k = 0 for i in range(n//2, n): for j in range(2, n, pow(2,j)): k = k + n / 2 . My answer: 2 (Correct) . Reasoning: This one had me a bit unsure since I struggled to understand the range function notation. Perhaps my lack of experience with it was the issue. While I recognized the first loop as linear, the second loop appeared to be incrementing in powers of two, similar to logarithmic growth with a base of 2. Consequently, I determined the time complexity to be O(n * log(2)(n)) or, more commonly, O(nlog(n)). . Question 4 . What does it mean when we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y? . My answer: 2 . Reasoning: Upon encountering the term &quot;asymptotically,&quot; I had to research its meaning. Consequently, I learned that it refers to X being more efficient than Y once n exceeds a certain positive constant limit. . Question 5 . What is the time complexity of the following code? . a = 0 i = N while (i &gt; 0): a += i i //= 2 . My answer: 4 . Reasoning: This problem presented a strange scenario as it bore similarities to the log base 2 example we had earlier, but had not been expressed as a while loop yet. Ultimately, I managed to give an informed response, but lacked complete confidence in my answer. . Question 6 . Which of the following best describes the useful criterion for comparing the efficiency of algorithms? . My answer: 3 . Reasoning: This is just a basic concept that we learned from the lesson. . Question 7 . How is time complexity measured? . My answer: 2 . Reasoning: It appeared to be a typical textbook definition, but I was uncertain about the meaning of the term &quot;primitive.&quot; Although I was aware that it did not involve determining the size of the data or merely counting the number of algorithms. . Question 8 . What will be the time complexity of the following code? . for i in range(n): i=i*k . My answer: 3 . Reasoning: From a mathematical perspective, the value can only be 3. The linear values of 1 or 2 are not viable since the program multiplies the variable i, which determines how long the program continues running, by k. Alternatively, we could interpret the program as running until k has multiplied by itself sufficiently to reach n, a point that would be graphically represented on a logarithmic scale. . Question 9 . What will be the time complexity of the following code? . value = 0 for i in range(n): for j in range(i): value=value+1 . My answer: 4 wrong Correct answer: 3 . Reasoning: This type of loop was new to me, and I struggled to convert it to Big O notation. After contemplating it further, I realized that the range function establishes n as a ceiling that can never be reached. For instance, if n were 2, the loop would iterate through 0 and 1 but never reach 2. Consequently, the time complexity of O(n * (n - 1)) seems appropriate. . Question 10 . Algorithm A and B have a worst-case running time of O(n) and O(logn), respectively. Therefore, algorithm B always runs faster than algorithm A. . My answer: 2 . Reasoning: One reason why I responded in this manner is that I tend to answer &quot;false&quot; whenever a question about time complexity is coupled with the phrase &quot;always runs faster.&quot; Additionally, even though I&#39;m not familiar with the concept of &quot;worst-case running time,&quot; I have observed that linear algorithms can occasionally outperform logarithmic ones, particularly when dealing with smaller values of n. .",

Uses PRAGMA statement to read schema. . Describe Schema, here is resource Resource- What is a database schema?: A database schema dictates how data is organized, such as with tables, fields, JSON, etc. . What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database?:The identity column helps identify different profiles in the database. It is unique to every profile, so it makes it able to distinguish users in the data. | What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database?:The purpose of the primary key is to make the data unique. This allows each profile in the data to be distinguishable from each other. | What are the Data Types in SQL table?:Exact numbers, approximate numbers, date and time, character strings, unicode character strings, binary strings, etc. | . import sqlite3 database = &#39;instance/sqlite.db&#39; # this is location of database def schema(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Fetch results of Schema results = cursor.execute(&quot;PRAGMA table_info(&#39;users&#39;)&quot;).fetchall() # Print the results for row in results: print(row) # Close the database connection conn.close() schema() .

Reading Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL SELECT statement to read data . What is a connection object? After you google it, what do you think it does?A connection object represents each SQLite database. I think it is responsible for connecting to the database so it can create cursor objects and transaction control. | Same for cursor object?:Yes, cursor object allows the use of commands, and also fetches the data.- Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger. What attributes are in the object?:conn.cursor() has attributes of special variables, function variables, class variables, in_transaction, isolation_level, row_factory, and total_changes. For the objects, all of the attributes say &quot;none.&quot; | Is &quot;results&quot; an object? How do you know?:&quot;Results can be an object because it prints out the entire database.

Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compore create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations?:Imperative:Has less code and is easier to work with than OOP. However, it is unable to check for garbage data such as in gradDate.- OOP: Has slightly more code and is somewhat harder to work with(less functions used). However, it is able to check for garbage data.- Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init?:SQL INSERT inserts the profile into the table(sqlite.db) with the parameters entered. It is the same as init. | . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #create() create() . A new user record yuri has been created . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do?:If the new password inputted is less than 2 characters, the code detects it as a hack and a new password is automatically created for you.- Explain try/except, when would except occur? : Try attempts to execute the code under it. If there is an error with executing the code, except occurs and executes the below code. This is useful because you can write code that continues to run even after hitting a problem or error. | What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated?: The code conn.cursor, cursor.execute, conn.commit, and cursor/conn.close is repeated. It is repeated because it constantly has to set up a cursor object and connection object. It has to be executed in order to do any actions, and must close at the end so that the code can end. | . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ?

Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why?:It is dangerous because once you delete an object, the object is gone forever.- In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do?: &#39;f&#39; makes the variables in the {var} available to use. Without &#39;f&#39;, {var} would not work. {uid} is the string that is fetched from the database, it displays the uid being deleted. | . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #delete() .

The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down.

Problem 15 “A city government is attempting to reduce the digital divide between groups with differing access to computing and the Internet. Which of the following activities is LEAST likely to be effective in this purpose?” . Putting all government forms on the city Web site | Explanation : This option is correct. Putting all government forms on the city website is least likely to be effective in reducing the digital divide because all citizens may not have equitable access to the Internet. | . | . Problem 22 “For each grid, the program below is intended to move the robot to the gray square. The program uses the procedure Goal_Reached ( ), which evaluates to true if the robot is in the gray square and evaluates to false otherwise.” . Grid I only | Explanation : This option is correct. In Grid I, the robot moves forward to the end of the bottom row, turns right twice, moves forward twice, turns right twice, moves forward until the end of the middle row, turns left twice, moves forward twice, turns left twice, and moves forward until Goal_Reached is true. | . | . Problem 31 “A programmer is creating an algorithm that will be used to turn on the motor to open the gate in a parking garage. The specifications for the algorithm are as follows.” . Check if the time is during business hours. If it is, check if the gate sensor is activated. If it is, check if the gate is open. If it is not, turn on the motor. | Explanation : Correct. The algorithm continues past the first check if the time is during business hours, the algorithm continues past the second check if the gate sensor is activated, and the algorithm continues past the third check if the gate is not open. Performing the checks in this order will ensure that the gate is opened only under the appropriate conditions. | . | . Problem 33 “Which of the following can be used as a replacement for so that the code segment works as intended?&quot; . REPEAT 2 TIMES | Explanation : Correct. The loop that repeats four times returns the robot to its starting position. The three lines of code that follow the loop move the robot one row up and leave it facing right. When this has been repeated twice, the robot is in the gray square. | . | . Problem 38 “Which of the following code segments is equivalent to the code segment above?” . Answer B | Explanation : Correct. The given code segment displays “positive” when num is positive, displays “negative” when num is negative, and displays “zero” when num is 0. This code segment produces the same result. When num is negative, “negative” is displayed. Otherwise, when num is 0, “zero” is displayed. Otherwise, “positive” is displayed. | . Problem 39 “Consider the goal of modifying the code segment to count the number of squares the robot visits before execution terminates. Which of the following modifications can be made to the code segment to correctly count the number of squares the robot moves to?” . Inserting the statement count ← count + 1 between line 6 and line 7 | Explanation : Correct. Inserting this statement between lines 6 and 7 increases the value of count once each time the robot moves forward, which keeps an accurate count of the number of squares the robot visits. | . | . Problem 49 “A city planner is using simulation software to study crowd flow out of a large arena after an event has ended. The arena is located in an urban city. Which of the following best describes a limitation of using a simulation for this purpose?” . The model used by the simulation software often omits details so that it is easier to implement. | Explanation : Correct. Simulations are limited by the model that is used. There may be many reasons for using a simplified model, including ease of implementation. | . | . Problem 50 “Based on the values in the table, which of the algorithms appear to run in reasonable time?” . A and B | Explanation : Correct. As the size of the list grows, the number of steps needed to sort the list grows at a linear rate, as the number of steps is equal to 10n for a list of size n. This is an example of a polynomial efficiency and indicates that the algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time. Correct. The number of steps for this algorithm is equal to the length of the list squared, as the number of steps is equal to n2 for a list of size n. This is an example of a polynomial efficiency and indicates that the algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time. | . | .",

Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? Binary is a base-2 numbering system that only employs two symbols to represent data, usually 0 and 1. The base-16 numbering system hexadecimal, on the other hand, uses 16 symbols to represent data, usually the digits 0–9 and the letters A–F. Using a set of 64 characters, usually made up of letters, digits, and symbols, Base64 is a way of encoding data. When representing binary data as text, such as in email files or URLs, Base64 is frequently used. Base64 was created especially to be human-readable and simple to use for non-technical users, in contrast to binary and hexadecimal. . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64.

Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? When an image is scaled, its aspect ratio is preserved while it is resized to a larger or smaller dimension. The ratio of an image&#39;s breadth to height is known as the aspect ratio. Each pixel in the original image is either expanded or compressed to suit the new size when an image is scaled. The overall visual appearance of the image may alter as a consequence. | Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? Scaling an image can be viewed as a form of compression, specifically as a form of lossy compression, which is a type of compression that reduces the file size of an image by removing or reducing redundant information or data that can be partially reconstructed without significantly sacrificing visual detail. | . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 320 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Set Properties of Image, Scale, and convert to Base64 def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(image[&#39;pil&#39;], image[&#39;format&#39;]) # Create Grey Scale Base64 representation of Image def image_management_add_html_grey(image): # Image open return PIL image object img = image[&#39;pil&#39;] format = image[&#39;format&#39;] img_data = img.getdata() # Reference https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pil-image-getdata/ image[&#39;data&#39;] = np.array(img_data) # PIL image to numpy array image[&#39;gray_data&#39;] = [] # key/value for data converted to gray scale # &#39;data&#39; is a list of RGB data, the list is traversed and hex and binary lists are calculated and formatted for pixel in image[&#39;data&#39;]: # create gray scale of image, ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-a-numpy-array-to-an-image/ average = (pixel[0] + pixel[1] + pixel[2]) // 3 # average pixel values and use // for integer division if len(pixel) &gt; 3: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average, pixel[3])) # PNG format else: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average)) # end for loop for pixels img.putdata(image[&#39;gray_data&#39;]) image[&#39;html_grey&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(img, format) # Jupyter Notebook Visualization of Images if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # Use numpy to concatenate two arrays images = image_data() # Display meta data, scaled view, and grey scale for each image for image in images: image_management(image) print(&quot;- meta data --&quot;) print(image[&#39;label&#39;]) print(image[&#39;source&#39;]) print(image[&#39;format&#39;]) print(image[&#39;mode&#39;]) print(&quot;Original size: &quot;, image[&#39;size&#39;]) print(&quot;Scaled size: &quot;, image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;]) print(&quot;-- original image --&quot;) display(HTML(image[&#39;html&#39;])) print(&quot; grey image -&quot;) image_management_add_html_grey(image) display(HTML(image[&#39;html_grey&#39;])) print() .

Question 1 - Which of the following is an advantage of a lossless compression algorithm over a lossy compression algorithm? I got this question right . Question 2 - A user wants to save a data file on an online storage site. The user wants to reduce the size of the file, if possible, and wants to be able to completely restore the file to its original version. Which of the following actions best supports the user’s needs? I got this question correct, I put A - Compressing the file using a lossless compression algorithm before uploading it. A is correct because lossless compression algorithms generally result in smaller data sizes while allowing for complete reconstruction of the original data. . Question 3 - A programmer is developing software for a social media platform. The programmer is planning to use compression when users send attachments to other users. Which of the following is a true statement about the use of compression? I got this question correct, I put C - Lossy compression of an image file generally provides a greater reduction in transmission time than lossless compression does. C is correct because while lossy compression may result in fewer bits being saved, information is not always lost. . Lossy vs Lossless compression hacks . The top is a Lossy Image. Is a JPG and it most likely contains lossy data. As a result of their use of a compression algorithm that discards some image data in order to decrease the file size, JPGs are a lossy format. The bottom uses lossless. The bottom is a lossless image. Since this picture is in PNG format, the likelihood that it is lossless is higher. PNG pictures use a compression algorithm that keeps all of the original image data without losing any information, making them a lossless image format. PNG images use a different type of compression algorithm than JPEG images, which is intended to keep the data while still achieving a smaller file size. JPEG images are made to shrink the file size by discarding some of the data. . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np class Image_Data: def __init__(self, source, label, file, path, baseWidth=320): self._source = source # variables with self prefix become part of the object, self._label = label self._file = file self._filename = path / file # file with path self._baseWidth = baseWidth # Open image and scale to needs self._img = pilImage.open(self._filename) self._format = self._img.format self._mode = self._img.mode self._originalSize = self.img.size self.scale_image() self._html = self.image_to_html(self._img) self._html_grey = self.image_to_html_grey() @property def source(self): return self._source @property def label(self): return self._label @property def file(self): return self._file @property def filename(self): return self._filename @property def img(self): return self._img @property def format(self): return self._format @property def mode(self): return self._mode @property def originalSize(self): return self._originalSize @property def size(self): return self._img.size @property def html(self): return self._html @property def html_grey(self): return self._html_grey # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(self): scalePercent = (self._baseWidth/float(self._img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(self._img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (self._baseWidth, scaleHeight) self._img = self._img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_html(self, img): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, self._format) return &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39;

The robot turns right one, two, or three times and could end up in a square to the left of its initial position. It cannot end up in a square above its initial position.

            "content": "Overview . For our group CPT project, we are doing a recipe suggester. We called our project reciPies. My share for the project is to create a favoriting system where a user who is logged in can favorite a recipe. This will allow them to see it again if they ever wanted to. . Purpose and Function . Purpose: allows a user who is logged in to favorite recipes they like so they can come back. . ​Function: There will be a frontend that allows a user to click a grey star. Once the star is clicked, the start will turn gold. When the user clicks the star it will save in a database linking to the logged on users account, that will have a table of saved recipes. . Data Abstraction . When the JSON data for all the saved recipes is parsed, then a list called userfavorites, will record all of the favorited recipes. This will recorded on a frontend table on the website. . Managing Complexity . Using a list called userfavorites it allows managing complexity because it allows the program to easily access the user favorites and append to a frontend table. . Procedural Abstraction . A procedure, called addFavorite(), would allow a user to add a favorite, appending it into the JSON list. I can also have a procedure called accessStorage() allowing it to access the data stored in the JSON file, and converting it to a format that I can use to code. . Algorithm Implementation . Sequencing will be used in order to sort the most recently added favorite recipe to the oldest recipe on the bottom. This is important because users can get a sense of time of how long ago they favorited the recipe. . Testing . My two tests would be with a review of the favorited recipes in the JSON list: . Test to see if when clicked the favorited recipe is added to the JSON list | Test the accessStorage() function to see if I’m able to access the stored favorited data. | Video Plan . I will show the input(clicking the button), reload the page and show how it saves. I will then go on the backend showing the JSON db with the stored feilds. After that I will go to the table page (frontend) which shows all the stored favorited recipes. .",

Hacks . The Big Picture purpose of this hack is to build a database. Being able to create an SQLite table and populate test data within it is the major goal. To do this effectively it is imperative to show the following. . Build Schema for a table, make a new model file and use users.py as an example. Start slow and simple and build up. | Build an initXXXXX() method and use it to add preliminary/test data to the table. Once again use users.py as an example. | Make a 30-60 second video where you show a Debugging session of making new rows in the table. Use sqlite marketplace tools and/or sqlite3 command line tool to show success in creating table and adding data. | Hack Helper . Here are some tips. . Become familiar with initUsers(). Observe it is called/activated from main.py. This function activates after you run the main.py and activate the web application in the browser. Observe that the sqlite.db file will appear in the volumes directory in conjunction with home screen of site appearing in browser. . | Delete sqlite.db from volumes directory on your development machine. Set breakpoint on initUsers() and run main.py using debug. Use the step into option on the debugger and observe the creation of data. . | . @app.before_first_request def activate_job():initJokes() initUsers() . Make your own XXXXX.py file under model directory. Follow users.py and develop your own schema from the OOP code you did in last Hacks. Follow the pattern in users.py to make a initXXXX() function top populate some test data. . | In main.py, add your initXXXX() method to def activate_job() function shown above. Use this as basis of your video debugging session. Debugging is hugely important at this level to understand your database success prior to building an API. Building initXXXX() method, adding database records, and debugging will enable you to verify CRUD operations as you develop. . | .",

Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to help students understand how to make an efficient program and optimize it and understand its importance to the CSP curriculum. . What is Algorithmic Efficiency? . The ability of an algorithm to solve a problem in an efficient way An efficient algorithm solves a problem quickly and with a minimum amount of resources, such as time and memory. | . | How do we determine if an algorithm is efficient or not? One way we can do this is by determining the time complexity of the algorithm. | Another way is through space complexity. | . | . Traveling Merchant Problem Hacks: . What did you and your team discuss? (record below) . An heurustic solution is that produces a solution that isn&#39;t necessarily is approach to a problem but can be used when normal methods take forever | . Describe the method used to solve the traveling merchant problem. (record below) . To solve this traveling merchant problem, traveling in a circle through the different cities that are closes to each other. This method seems like its the best. | . 3.18: Undecidable Problems . Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important. . Key vocabulary: . Decision problem | Decidable problem | Undecidable problem | . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A decidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An undecidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. . Example of a Decidable Problem . The procedure below tests to see if a number is divisible by 13. If it is, it returns true. If it isn&#39;t, it returns false. . def divideThirteen(number): if number % 13 == 0: return True else: return False print(divideThirteen(26)) print(divideThirteen(30)) . True False . Undecidable Problems . An Example of a Forever Running Code . The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory). However, there is no end to this code, making the computer run forever. There is no halt to the code. . i = 0 number = 1 def integerTest(n): # Testing if the number is an integer if n%1 ==0: return True else: return False # Using while loop to keep searching an a non-integer above 1. Note that the computer runs forever. while i == 0: number += 1 if integerTest(number) == False: i +=1 print(&quot;Done&quot;) . The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an undecidable problem. It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. . There is no way to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not. . Halting Problem Example: . In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let&#39;s call this algorithm HaltChecker. | HaltChecker analyzes the program,program P, and its input,input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;halts&quot;. If program P doesn&#39;t halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the code runs forever, so HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. | Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker&#39;s output. So, if &quot;never&quot; is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is &quot;halts&quot;. It&#39;s also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of &quot;halts&quot;, then Reverser has an output of &quot;never&quot;. | We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code. | Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints &quot;never&quot; when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints &quot;halts&quot; when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem. | . This Diagram Sums up the Entire Process in the Bulleted List: . Credits of diagram and example to Khan Academy . FAQ . Q: If Reverser is causing the problem, why not remove it? | A: Removing Reverser will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate. | . Extra Things to Notice . Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever. | Humans are able to solve some undecidable problems. The entire Halting Problem example was to prove that computers cannot solve undecidable problems. | . Hacks . Come up with one situation in which a computer runs into an undecidable problem. Explain why it is considered an undecidable problem. . An example of a undecidable problem in a computer could be when a computer is trying to determine if a program will run forever or if it would eventually stop.This is known as the halting problem, and it is considered undecidable because there is no algorithmic way to determine whether a program will halt or not. This is because it is possible for a program to be written in such a way that it can check its own execution and determine whether it will halt or not, but this would require the program to be able to solve the halting problem itself, which is impossible. Therefore, the halting problem is considered undecidable. | . 3.17 Homework . Your homework for Algorithmic Efficiency is pretty simple. . Use the 1st code below and graph it (Desmos, TI Inpire Cas, e.t.c), change the x value only! | Label the number of loops done as x and the time (microseconds) to find the index as y | Connect the points | Do the same thing with the 2nd code | Compare the two graphs and explain which one of the two is more efficient and why (min. 2 sentences) | Insert images of the graph either in your blog or on review ticket | Graph 1 . Graph2 . The Binary search is way more fast compared to the linear search in graph 1. In the linear search, the time it takes to find a high valued number is higher compared to a lower number. In a binary search, the time it takes to locate the value is the same no matter how high the value is making Graph 2 or the binary search better. . import time def linear_search(lst, x): start_time = time.perf_counter_ns() # records time (nanoseconds) for i in range(len(lst)): # loops through the entire list if lst[i] == x: # until the x value we are looking for is found end_time = time.perf_counter_ns() # records time again total_time = (end_time - start_time) // 1000 # subtracts last recorded time and first recorded time print(&quot;Found element after {} loops in {} microseconds&quot;.format(i+1, total_time)) # prints the results return print(&quot;Your number was found at&quot;, i) end_time = time.perf_counter_ns() # records the time again total_time = (end_time - start_time) // 1000 # subtracts last recorded time and first recorded time print(&quot;Element not found after {} loops in {} microseconds&quot;.format(len(lst), total_time)) # prints the results return &quot;Your number wasn&#39;t found :(&quot; lst = list(range(1, 10001)) # list with numbers 1-10000 x = 1000 # replace with an integer between 1 and 10000 (I suggest big numbers like 500, 2000, so on) linear_search(lst, x) # runs procedure .

Given a height and a weight, they calculate how long it will take for a object to fall to the ground in a vacuum subjected to normal Earth levels of gravity. .

This is useful for if you wanted a visual representation of a falling object, which pure math can&#39;t do as smoothly. . height = float(input(&quot;height in meters?&quot;)) weight = input(&quot;weight in pounds?&quot;) stuff = (2 * (height / 9.8))**(1/2) print(&quot;It will take&quot;, stuff,&quot;seconds for an object that weighs&quot;,weight,&quot;pounds&quot;,&quot;to fall &quot;,height,&quot;meters in a vacuum&quot;) .

Simulations in the wild . Simulations are used extremely frequently in real life applications. One of the most common examples of simulations are video games. A games physics engine can accurately simulate objects colliding . Another example is Blender, the software used in 3d animations class, here at Del Norte. Blender is made up of many small simulations, but one big one it uses is simulating the way light bounces off of and interacts with objects. . HW !!! . Create a simulation. It can be anything, just has to simulate something. . Some ideas: . Two objects colliding | Gravity on other planets | . AND .

A library is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations. | These precompiled codes can be referred to as modules. Each module contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. | A library may also contain documentation, configuration data, message templates, classes, and values, etc. | . Why are libraries important? . Using Libraries makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. | One example would be through looping and iteration, as we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. | Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc. | . A few libraries that simplify coding processes: . Pillow allows you to work with images. | Tensor Flow helps with data automation and monitors performance. | Matplotlib allows you to make 2D graphs and plots. | . The AP Exam Refrence Sheet itself is a library! . Hacks: . Research two other Python Libraries NOT DISCUSSED DURING LESSON and make a markdown post, explaining their function and how it helps programmers code. . hashlib, pygame | . API&#8217;s . An Application Program Interface, or API, contains specific direction for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. | An API acts as a gateway for the imported procedures from a library to interact with the rest of your code. | . Activity: Walkthrough with NumPy . Install NumPy on VSCode: Open New Terminal In VSCode: | pip3 install --upgrade pip | pip install numpy | | . REMEMBER: When running library code cells use Python Interpreter Conda (Version 3.9.12) . Example of using NumPy for arrays: . import numpy as np new_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]) print (new_matrix) . [[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9]] . Example of using NumPy for derivatives: . import numpy as np # defining polynomial function var = np.poly1d([2, 0, 1]) print(&quot;Polynomial function, f(x): n&quot;, var) # calculating the derivative derivative = var.deriv() print(&quot;Derivative, f(x)&#39;=&quot;, derivative) # calculates the derivative of after # given value of x # print(&quot;When x=5 f(x)&#39;=&quot;, derivative(5)) . Polynomial function, f(x): 2 2 x + 1 Derivative, f(x)&#39;= 4 x When x=5 f(x)&#39;= 20 . Random Values . Random number generation (RNG) produces a random number (crazy right?) This means that a procedure with RNG can return different values even if the parameters (inputs) do not change | . | CollegeBoard uses RANDOM(A, B), to return an integer between integers A and B. RANDOM(1, 10) can output 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 | In Python, this would be random.randint(A, B), after importing Python&#39;s &quot;random&quot; library (import random) | JavaScript&#39;s works a little differently, with Math.random() returning a value between 0 and 1. To match Python and CollegeBoard, you could make a procedure like this | . | . | . CollegeBoard Example: What is the possible range of values for answ3 . Convert the following procedure to Python, then determine the range of outputs if n = 5. . PROCEDURE Dice(n) sum ← 0 REPEAT UNTIL n = 0 sum ← sum + RANDOM(1, 6) n ← n - 1 RETURN sum . import random # Fill in the blank def Dice(n): sum = 0 while(n!=0): sum = sum + random.randint(1,6) n = n-1 return(sum) Dice(5) # Will output a range of __ to __ . 21 . Homework . Write a procedure that generates n random numbers, then sorts those numbers into lists of even and odd numbers (JS or Python, Python will be easier). . | Using NumPy and only coding in python cell, find the answer to the following questions: a. What is the derivative of 2x^5 - 6x^2 + 24x? b. What is the derivative of (13x^4 + 4x^2) / 2 when x = 9? . | Suppose you have a group of 10 dogs and 10 cats, and you want to create a random order for them. Show how random number generation could be used to create this random order. . | import random def genSort(n): tempList = [] evenList = [] oddList = [] # loops and adds all the randomly generated numbers into temp list for i in range(n): nums = random.randint(1,30) tempList.append(nums) # loops through the length of templist, and checks if the number position is even or odd and appends accordingly for j in range(len(tempList)): # Even if tempList[j]%2 == 0: evenList.append(tempList[j]) continue # Odd else: oddList.append(tempList[j]) continue # prints odd list and even list print(str(tempList) + &quot; List of Generated Nums&quot;) print(str(evenList) + &quot; List of Sorted Evens&quot;) print(str(oddList)+ &quot; List of Sorted Odds&quot;) genSort(random.randint(1,10)) .

The lesson will start off with introducing what algorithms are and what they do, moreover, what their significance is. . 3.9 Lesson 1 has the objective to teach the student of the outcome of similar algorithmic concepts and similar algorithms. In this lesson, you will see different ways on how algorithms are developed. . Lesson 1 | Defining Algorithms . What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed through CODE. There are set limitations, this is what makes algorithms fun, you can your imagination and create whatever you wan with your own instructions! . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks . | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results. . | Some conditional statements can be written as the same as Boolean expressions (VICE VERSA) . | Different algorithms can be developed or use to solve the same problem. . | . Example 1 | What happens if we test the algorithm with different outputs? . The pseudocode above is translated to python for you. . Record what your outputs are when you enter 95 degrees F, does the algorithm yield the same result? . The conditional below is nested . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then 95, what do you notice? . It&#39;s too hot outside! . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then Input 95, what do you notice? . It&#39;s too hot outside! Sure I will play outside! . NOW RECORD with another output . Record what your outputs are when you enter 54, does the algorithm yield the same result this time? . *Now use 95 as an input for the two code blocks above. . Even though an algorithm&#39;s code can look the same, you have to be careful, they can always yield different results. When constructing algorithms you want to make sure that your code corresponds with what you want as your output. You set the limit of your code and you decide what the code&#39;s output is. . Conditionals vs. Booleans . The condition and instructions are what differ, that&#39;s where the magic happens. The condition is a boolean expression when an expression outputs either true or false. Boolean values are another type of data type in programming languages, and they can only ever hold true or false. . Exercise . Learning how to utilize conditionals and booleans are important for developing algorithms. Use this exercise to help you. . Can either Boolean expression on the right replace the conditional on the left? Assume isWeekday and isHoliday are Boolean variables. . *NOTE = you can edit the variables to check the conditions needed! . IsHoliday = False IsWeekday = True if IsHoliday: driveWork = True else: if IsWeekday: driveWork = True else: driveWork = False print(driveWork) . Logically thinking about conditionals and booleans . Now the problem may seem confusing, but the best way to develop an algorithm is to think about all the possible results that can be potentially be outputted. . So if IsHoliday is set to true, then driveWork is automatically equal to false and it does not matter what value of isWeekday is. This must mean that one of the conditionals must be NOT IsHoliday. . In the case that lets say IsHoliday is set to false, then the variable for weekday needs to be checked. If it&#39;s true then driveWork is true, if it&#39;s false then driveWork is false. This must mean that the other conditional isWeekday. . Combining both conditionals, you get option 2, which is not IsHoliday and IsWeekday. This is why option 2 is right! . Example 3 | Conditionals vs Booleans . The following algorithms are intended to sum the odd numbers from 1-9. Which algorithms work as intended? . Below, I have translated the block code into python, import this to your jupyter notebook and record the result. What do you notice? . First block . sum = 1 counter = 3 #iteration var = 0 while (var &lt; 4): #while the var is &lt;= 4, it executes those commands, once it exceeds it hits the else command sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 var = var + 1 # now go through the whole thing 4 times, this is an iteration, a vital part of algorithms. else: print(sum) . 25 . Second block . sum = 0 counter = 9 #iteration while (counter &gt;= 1): sum = sum + counter counter = counter - 2 print(sum) . 25 . When we start our initializing left sum as 1 counter as 3 we had no iterations yet. Remember we&#39;re going to have to repeat this four times because the block code prompts us to repeat 4 times, so we iterate. So as we go through and follow what the block gives us. . So you see that the sum does work, it does sum up the odd numbers from 1-9 . Now lets look at the right block. . Sum is set to 0 Counter is set to 9 We must repeat until the counter &lt; 1 is true. . So we keep adding until -1, that is when the counter &lt; 1 is true, so we stop . So why is it important to understand that algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same task? . An algorithm is beautiful that way, just because you think of solving a problem differently, doesn&#39;t mean your wrong, . 3.9 Part 2 . Flowcharts . Flowcharts can help you visualize the functionality of an algorithm . | They are a good way to double check whether or not your algorithm is achieving its purpose . | . How To Set Up A Flowchart . label the start point . | Define any and all variables you may need . | Consider the first question you want the algorithm to ask . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is yes (or true) . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is no (or false) . Steps 3-5 are the steps to creating code that uses a process called selection (you can convert the question from step 3 to a conditional if-statement in code) | . | Write out all necessary steps for the algorithm to function properly . | You may want your algorithm to iterate some steps until a condition is met . You can write the steps that need to be repeated, then draw an arrow from the last step to a step above that contains a conditional statement | . | determine a way to reach the end goal | Selection vs. Iteration . Selection: . A process used in algorithms where a conditional if-statement leads to one of two outcomes . Outcome 1: if the conditional statement is true, something will happen . | Outcome 2: if the conditional statement is false, something else will happen . | Ex: see Example A . | . | . | Iteration . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied . Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced . | This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement . | . | . | . Example A . Consider this situation: . You are shopping for your favorite food at your favorite supermarket . | You see that there is a sale on wheat products for 35% off . | There is another sale on produce for 20% off . | These sales are mutually exclusive . | Tax on all items is 8% . | . | Your TASK: .

Goals/Objectives: . detirmine number of iterations required to find vlue in data set. | explain requirements for binary search | . What is Binary Search? . Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. | An algorithm for iterating to find a value inside a data set | . About Binary Search: . Binary Search Algorithm starts in the middle of a data set of numbers and eliminates half the data. This process reapeats until the desired value is found or until all elements have been eliminated. | In order to use binary search effectivly and properly, data must be stored in order | COLLEGE BOARD INDEX STARTS AT 1 NOT 0 | . Think about how you would you would try to find a certain number in this set. . One way would be to line up the numbers and count them individually untill you find the desired value. . When working with large data sets with lots of numbers, methods like these wont work . Instead, a Binary Search would be more effective. | . Here we can see the numbers are set in an increasing order. Setting numbers in an increasing or decreasing is needed for a binary search . Binary search is started with the middle number first Middle number is found by taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two | . | Binary Search can be represented using a tree as shown below | . . Heres an easy way to put it: . binary search fidns the desired element by continuously chopping the search area in half | say the element you are looking for is &#39;f&#39; | . [a b c d e f g h] . We would start in the middle at element &#39;d&#39; | becuase our target is greater than d we will eliminate everything left of &#39;d&#39; including &#39;d&#39; (chopping it in half) . [e f g h] is what now remains . again we would &#39;chop in half&#39; | say we iterate through &#39;g&#39; and &#39;h&#39;, our desired element is still not found so we would eliminate &#39;g; and &#39;h&#39; and continue the process | . [e f] . now we are down to 2 elements | &#39;chopping in half&#39; will give us our desired element | . [f] . | . def BinarySearch(array, x, low, high): # Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each other while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low)//2 # find the middle (taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two) if array[mid] == x: # if desired number is the middle is found return desired number (middle number) return mid elif array[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return -1 array = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] x = 4 result = BinarySearch(array, x, 0, len(array)-1) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not found&quot;) . Element is present at index 1 . We have created a function called binary_search() function which takes two arguments - a list to be sorted and a number to be searched. . | We have declared two variables to store the lowest and highest values in the list. The lowest is assigned initial value to 0, the highest to len(list1) 1 and mid as 0. . | Next, we have declared the while loop with the condition that the lowest is equal and smaller than the highest. The while loop will iterate if the number has not been found yet. . | In the while loop, we find the mid value and compare the index value to the number we are searching for. . | If the value of the mid-index is smaller than n, we increase the mid value by 1 and assign it to the low. The search moves to the left side. . | Otherwise, if the value of mid index is larger than n, we decrease the mid value by 1 and assign it to the high. The search moves to the right side. . | If the n is equal to the mid value then return mid. . | This will happen until the low is equal and smaller than the high. . | If we reach at the end of the function, then the element is not present in the list. We return -1 to the calling function. . | . . Hacks . Using my example above and steps below, create your own iteration using binary search . Steps . Compare x with the middle element. | If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index. | Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half. | Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half. | .

Coding all of these individually takes a lot of unnecessary time, how can we shorten this time? . Iteration . Iteration is the repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. There&#39;s a lot of types of iteration though, what to use? How do we apply iteration to lists? . Some methods include using a &quot;for loop&quot;, using a &quot;for loop and range()&quot;, using a &quot;while loop&quot;, and using comprehension . Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable objects. They are the &#39;containers&#39; that store the data to iterate. . Each of these containers are able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration:definite and indefinite. Definite iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met . for variable in iterable: statement() . Iterator? Iterable? Iteration? . When an object is iterable it can be used in an iteration | When passed through the function iter() it returns an iterator | Strings, lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples are all examples of iterable objects. | . a = [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;bravo&#39;, &#39;charlie&#39;] itr = iter(a) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) . alpha bravo charlie .

Else:when the condition does not meet, do statement()- Elif: when the condition does not meet, but meets another condition, do statement() | Break: stop the loop | . HW Iteration . Use the list below to turn the first letter of any word (using input()) into its respective NATO phonetic alphabet word . Ex: . list -&gt; . lima india sierra tango . words = [&quot;alfa&quot;, &quot;bravo&quot;, &quot;charlie&quot;, &quot;delta&quot;, &quot;echo&quot;, &quot;foxtrot&quot;, &quot;golf&quot;, &quot;hotel&quot;, &quot;india&quot;, &quot;juliett&quot;, &quot;kilo&quot;, &quot;lima&quot;, &quot;mike&quot;, &quot;november&quot;, &quot;oscar&quot;, &quot;papa&quot;, &quot;quebec&quot;, &quot;romeo&quot;, &quot;sierra&quot;, &quot;tango&quot;, &quot;uniform&quot;, &quot;victor&quot;, &quot;whiskey&quot;, &quot;xray&quot;, &quot;yankee&quot;, &quot;zulu&quot;] inp = input().lower() for i in range(len(inp)): for j in range(len(words)): if inp[i] == words[j][0]: print(words[j]) . foxtrot oscar romeo tango november india tango echo . 2D Iteration . 2D Arrays . A 2D array is simply just a list of lists. The example below is technically correct but... . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Conventially 2D arrays are written like below. This is because 2D arrays are meant to be read in 2 dimensions (hence the name). Writing them like below makes them easier to visualize and understand. . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Printing a 2D Array . We already know that we can&#39;t just print the matrix by calling it. We need to iterate through it to print it. . def print_matrix1(matrix): for i in range(len(matrix)): # outer for loop. This runs on i which represents the row. range(len(matrix)) is in order to iterate through the length of the matrix for j in range(len(matrix[i])): # inner for loop. This runs on the length of the i&#39;th row in the matrix (j changes for each row with a different length) print(matrix[i][j], end=&quot; &quot;) # [i][j] is the 2D location of that value in the matrix, kinda like a coordinate pair. [i] iterates to the specific row and [j] iterates to the specific value in the row. end=&quot; &quot; changes the end value to space, not a new line. print() # prints extra line. this is in the outer loop, not the inner loop, because it only wants to print a new line for each row . print(&quot;Raw matrix (list of lists): &quot;) print(keypad) print(&quot;Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration:&quot;) print_matrix1(keypad) print() . Raw matrix (list of lists): [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&#39; &#39;, 0, &#39; &#39;]] Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . def print_matrix2(matrix): for row in matrix: # Iterates through each &quot;row&quot; of matrix. Row is a dummy variable, it could technically be anything. It iterates through each value of matrix and each value is it&#39;s own list. in this syntax the list is stored in &quot;row&quot;. for col in row: # Iterates through each value in row. Again col, column, is a dummy variable. Each value in row is stored in col. print(col, end=&quot; &quot;) # Same as 1 print() # Same as 1 print_matrix2(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . More Functions . Try to find another way to print the matrix. Only complete one of the two (unless you&#39;d like to do both). Below is a hint . fruit = [&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;bananas&quot;, &quot;grapes&quot;] print(fruit) print(*fruit) # Python built in function: &quot;*&quot;. Figure out what it does . [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;bananas&#39;, &#39;grapes&#39;] apples bananas grapes . def print_matrix3(matrix): for i in range(len(keypad)): print(*keypad[i]) print_matrix3(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . Alternatively, find a way to print the matrix using the iter() function you already learned. Or use both! . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] . Print what month you were born and how old you are by iterating through the keyboard (don&#39;t just write a string). . print(keyboard[2][6], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[2][0], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[3][5], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[1][6], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[2][0], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[1][3], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[1][5], end=&quot;&quot;) #comma print(keyboard[3][7], end=&quot;&quot;) # age print(keyboard[0][1], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[0][5], end=&quot;&quot;) . JANUARY,15 . Challenge . Change all of the letters that you DIDN&#39;T print above to spaces, &quot; &quot;, and then print the full keyboard. (the things you did print should remain in the same spot) . Alternative Challenge: If you would prefer, animate it using some form of delay so it flashes one of your letters at a time on the board in order and repeats. (this one may be slightly more intuitive) . DO NOT HARD CODE THIS. Don&#39;t make it harder on yourself, iterate through, make it abstract so it can be used dynamically. You should be able to input any string and your code should work. . . 1 6 R A H C M . If you get stuck you can just make a picture with an array and print it (I will grade based on how good it looks) . I do expect an attempt so write some code to show you tried the challenge. .",

What is a boolean? . A data type with two possible values: true or false | . Boolean and Binary . So similar yet so different. . Boolean math and binary notation both use the same two ciphers: 1 and 0. | However, please note that Boolean quantities are restricted to a singlular bit (can only be either 1, or 0) | On the otherhand, binary numbers may be composed of many bits adding up in place-weighted form to any finite value, or size | . Must Knows . A Boolean value is either TRUE or FALSE | The AP Exam will provide you with a reference sheet with the operators below. | . A few ways these operators could be used... | . Relational Operators in action . How could you use operators to determine if the average of 5 grades is greater than 80? | . With the grades below, use a boolean expression to determine if the average grade is above an 80 and print the result (True or False) | Try it in as few steps as possible! | Be creative! There are obviously TONS of different practical solutions | . grade1 = 90 grade2 = 65 grade3 = 60 grade4 = 75 grade5 = 95 gradeAvg = (grade1+grade2+grade3+grade4+grade5)/5 print(gradeAvg &gt; 80) .

Logical Operators! . These types of operators don&#39;t necessarily deal with equivalent/non-equivalent values, but they rather work on operands to produce a singular boolean result . AND : returns TRUE if the operands around it are TRUE | OR : returns TRUE if at least one operand is TRUE | NOT : returns TRUE if the following boolean is FALSE | . Turn the following arithmetic phrases into either True or False statements as indicated USING LOGICAL OPERATORS . print(&quot;1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12:&quot;, 1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12) # Output TRUE using OR ^ # Output FALSE using NOT print(&quot;24 &gt; 8:&quot;,24 &gt; 8) # Output FALSE using AND print(&quot;10 &gt; 20:&quot;, 10 &gt; 20 and False) . 1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12: True 24 &gt; 8: True 10 &gt; 20: False . Lesson Overview: 3.6 - Conditionals . Focusing on Selection . Selection: uses a condition that evaluates to true or false . Selection determines which part of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false . Algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task . Conditional Statements . Also known as &quot;if statements&quot; . Can be seen as if statements or if blocks . Can also be seen as if else statements or if else-blocks . x = 20 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) . x is greater than y . x = 9 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is not greater than y&quot;) . x is not greater than y .

Restaurants are recommended based on whether they can accommodate all allergies and dietary restrictions, not based on whether group members have been there before. Information about which food allergies and dietary restrictions can be accommodated at nearby restaurants is needed so that a restaurant can be recommended for the group. . Question 28 . This code segment incorrectly charges customers who use more than 25 units of electricity. These customers are charged $7 per unit for all units, when they should be charged this rate only for the number of units above 25. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 – 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. This code segment would incorrectly charge the customer $224 for the 32 units. . Question 35 . The last line in this code segment sets maxPS to 50 regardless of the value of time. . Question 42 . After initially assigning values to the variables, the code segment assigns the value 4 to num3 and assigns the value 8 to num1. The value of sum at the end of the code segment is 8 + 4 + 4, or 16. . Question 43 . This is the value of x after the code segment is executed, not the value of result. . Question 47 . The eighth statement assigns the value of c + d / 2 (which is 50) to d. .

Last year when I was a freshman, I took this class. For the first trimester final you are supposed to create a digital created scene with a donut, water cup, table, chair and room with some sort of background. This class was very interesting seeing the different types of unique ways people designed their scenes. I chose one scene that I thought looked the best below. . . Ceramics .

The main issue when trying to complete the assignment was when running the command “sudo docker-compose up -d”, here was the issue I was presented with: . . Originally I had a parsing error which was caused by me placing the wrong code into the “docker compose yml file”. The way I fixed this was by opening the flask repository in vscode, and manually copying and pasting the code there and pushing it. . . Going back to the current issue, some ways I tried resolving was making sure my team’s individual flask’s were set up correctly meaning they were on different ports, and had the correct directory implemented in their docker compose yml file. I also reached out to Mr Yeung, who attempted to help me, but was not able to. .",

            "content": "1.1: Daily Video 1 . A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function | A computing innovation can be physical, nonphysical computer software, or nonphysical computing concept | Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias in the development of computing innovations | Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it | . Daily Video 1: Takeaways . Interpersonal skills learned through collaboration: Communication | Consensus Building | Conflict Resolution | Negotiation | . | . 1.1: Daily Video 2 . Pair Programming Two programmers work together as a pair | One programmer is the driver, who writes code, and the other programmer is the observer/pointer/navigator, who reviews each line of code as it is typed in | . | Think-Pair-Share Students first think through a problem by themselves, pair up with a partner to exchange ideas, and then share findings with the class | . | Leave Comments in Code! Communicate to your partner(s) | Communicate to yourself | Acknowledge code segments used from other sources | Acknowledge media used from other sources | Differentiate what you and your partner(s) did | Clarify the functionality of your code | . | How to Collaborate in Class Online Tools repl.it - multiplayer | GitHub - collaboration and repository | Shared document or folder | . | Ask friends and family to test drive your prgoram and give you feedback! | Check with your teacher for your coding platform | . | . Daily Video 2: Takeaways . Consultation and communication with users are important aspects of the development of computing innovations | Information gathered from potential users can be used to understand the purpose of a program from diverse perspectives and to develop a program that fully incorporates these perspectives | Online tools support collaboration by allowing programmers to share and provide feedback on ideas and documents | Common models such as pair programming exist to facilitate collaboration | . Personal Takeways . Watching these videos definitely opened my mind to how crucial collaboration is, especially in a field like computer science. I hope that from now on, my team and I will be able to communicate with each other and help each other no matter the circumstances. . 1.2: Daily Video 1 . Computing Innovations . Innovations can include, but are not limited to: . Applications Games | Social Media | Business | Productivity | . | Physical Devices Computers | Smart Phones/tablets | Smart “Things” | Wearables | . | Systems E-commerce | Cloud services | E-mail | . | . Innovations Created for a Purpose . Guiding Questions: . Why does the computing innovation exist? | What problem(s) does the computing innovation solve? | What does the computing innovation allow us to do that we could not do before? | Examples of Computing Innovations . Social Media Applications Allows users to connect from a distance and archive their activites | . | E-commerce Allows users to save time and money by being able to shop from home | . | Digital Assistant Device Allows users to control their devices hands-free making them safer while driving or more convenient when trying to multitask | . | . Daily Video 1: Takeaways . The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interest through creative expression | An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovations provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation | . 1.2: Daily Video 2 . Identifying Inputs to Programs . Computer Programs accept input in a variety of different forms: . tactile (touch) | audio | visual | text (including numerical values) | . Examples: . Smart phone/tablet (texting, entering password, etc.) | Laptop computer (keyboard, mouse, etc.) | Gaming console (send input through buttons) | . How do programs receive input? . Most programs are written in an event driven environment. . “Events” are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program | . Types of events a user can trigger: . mouse clicks | screen taps/swipes (force touch) | . What does input accomplish in a program? . Input usually affects the output. Outputs produced by a device can include: . visual | audio | tactile (touch/feel) | text | . Example of output that devices supply: . Smart phone/tablet (things that appear on screen based on what you have pressed/swiped) | Laptop computer (displays texts after using keyboard) | Gaming console (remote vibrations) | . How does a program know what to do upon an event? . An action triggers an event: . Action may be activated by the user or another program/device | . The program “jumps” to the code segment according to the event: . The code segment is ran | Output is triggered by the code segment/additional events that are triggered | . The program does not necessarily execute “in order”: . Code segments are executed as they are called, according to the events triggered | . Daily Video 2: Takeaways . Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text | An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program | Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution | Inputs USUALLY affect the output produced by a program | Program output is usually based on a program’s input or prior state | . 1.2: Daily Video 3 . What is a program? . A program is a collection of statements: . A statement is a single command | A group of statements is called a code segment | A program is often referred to as “software” | Code segments are executed by rules of the coding language | . What does the program shown in the video do? - written to find the minimum value in a list . The code segment should work for a variety of different lists, such as numbers that are out of order, negative numbers, large numbers, and decimals | . Description . Simply state what the segment does this way, someone else can use the segment in a larger program | . | Include how it does what it does this way, someone could expand upon the code segment | . | . Daily Video 3: Takeaways . A program is a collection of program statements that performs a task when run by a computer | A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program | A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations | . Personal Takeways . After watching all three videos, I feel that I truly understand why knowing the purpose and function of a program is essential. Knowing exactly what your program is intended to do could allow someone who is reading it to use it in a larger program or even expand upon it. Overall, having knowledge about this big idea will definitely be helpful and I will apply this idea to anything that I do in this class. . 1.3: Daily Video 1 . How is a program developed? . It all starts with an idea. . Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan | At times, the development is more exploratory than anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad) | . Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect . Investigation is an important step in the process | Developers must: determine the requirements of the program | understand the constraints | understand the user concerns and interests | . | How do developers investigate? surveys | user testing | interviews | direct observations | . | . After initial investigation and reflection… . Developers design the program by brainstorming (draw on investigation) | storyboarding the program | planning user experience | laying out the user interface | organizing into modules | develop a testing strategy | . | Developers decide on the program requirements that… describe how a program should behave | include a list of user interactions | . | The program specifications outline all of the requirements | Developers create a prototype of the program (or components): a gradual process is frequently used so that developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program | . | . Testing, testing, and more testing! . Developers test the program every step of the way | Testing occurs at the micro level | macro level | . | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection | . Daily Video 1 Personal Takeaways . After watching the first daily video of 1.3, I now realize that if I want to have my idea for the final project behave like it is supposed to that numerous trials of the program will have to be run. This way, we can all see what parts of the program should be kept as is and which parts need to be modified to ensure optimal user experience. . 1.3: Daily Video 2 . How is a program developed? . Program development is seldom a solo endeavor . Typically, programs are developed by teams of people | Individuals/teams work on different functional components | Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work | Their names must be written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project | . While documentation is an important place to give credit… . Many projects use comments within the programming language to give credit | This is an important part of the development of the program | When developers find a bug/error in a program, they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem | This may be most useful after a program is completed, and users find additional bugs | . Many times developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms, and more that are written by others. . These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited | Similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article | Any code segments, procedures, or algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author | The program documentation should include the author’s name and the source of any code segments being used | This portion of the documentation may resemble a bibliography or a works cited pages in a research paper | . Daily Video 2 Personal Takeways . I now know that any time I use code segments or algorithms, whether they are from my teammates or outside sources, I should always in some way give credit to the original author of that part of the program. This is because any code segments, procedures, or algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author. . 1.3: Daily Video 3 . How is a program developed? . Programmers create something called program documentation in order to… . describe the overall program | list program specifications | describe… functions/procedures/methods within the code | specific code segments | list of events and corresponding outputs | the development of the program | how other programs may interact with the program | . | list of contributors/authors of the program | . When does documentation happen? . Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: . At the beginning: list specifications | During: to keep track of proceess | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throughout can improve: | efficiency of overall programming process | programmers’ ability to test and refine the program | programmers’ response to bugs | . How do programmers document while programming? . Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not. . Commenting allows programmers to write text within the prgoram | This text does not affect the program | Comments are for programmers to read | This is a form of documentation and can be very usefil when programmers collaborate or work individually | . Daily Video 3 Personal Takeways . After watching this video, I now understand why it is important to include comments in code, as it allows one to understand what something does and how it was developed. .

First I made a “correct” and “incorrect”, and “start” screen. I also made the “quiz1” , “quiz2” , and “quiz3” screens that showed the questions. When the user starts the code, he is prompted with a start quiz button, once clicked he is directed to the quiz1 screen. If the answer is answerd correctly, the score will be logged +1 and the user will be redirected to the correct screen. If answerd incorrect, the score will be logged -1 and the user will be redirected to the incorrect screen. At the end the code brings up the “FinalScore” screen which shows the percent you got on the quiz. . Data Abstraction . In the image below you can see how I logged the score throughout the code.

            "content": "Idea 1 . Performance Task/Program Purpose and Function . For my APCSP project, I want to make an program that requests from blockchain APIs, and find if a transaction has confirmed towards a certain bitcoin address . The user will be able to input a bitcoin address or a TXID(transaction hash) into the program for the results. . Data Abstraction . In this program the data requested by the API’s will be stored in a dictionary. The program will access the data in the lists and dictionaries, and run them through functions that check if the transaction confirmed or is unconfirmed. The program will also store data about the transaction like fees, and dates on when the transaction was initiated. . Managing Complexity . This is still being thought out, but the main idea is to ideitify information based on a transation using the blockchain. It will output data like the transaction fees, and how long it takes or took the transaction to confirm on the blockchain. . Procedural Abstraction . The procedure for this program is to first take a TXID input by the user, then to request from blockchain APIs about the transaction. The API responses are then saved in a dictionary that are extracted and formated for the user to interpret. . Algorithm Implementation . The algorithm implementation would have to do with parsing/iterating the data saved in the dictionary. My program would need to assosiate variables with certain data. The Algorithm would need to loop through the data to output the right information the user. . Testing . For the testing, I will demonstrate how to use the program through a short video. I will also include a written documentation that explains how the program works as well as how to use it. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
