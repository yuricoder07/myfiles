What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure?\n", " - Personally, I'm not okay with PII and personal exposure. Whenever using the internet I try to be the most discrete as I can be. I'm okay with my first name being known on the internet as millions of other people have the same name. PII is great for people that need to identify you and can help them dig up some of your greatest accomplishments and achievements.\n", "3. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.\n", " - Bad passwords generally consist of very common patterns and are often used for multiple different websites. For example, if someone's password is 12345 or like password123, there is really no variability in it and that makes it a lot easier to guess. Additionally, if the person that may try and compromise your account has some of your PII, even something like \"name\"_07 might be pretty easy to guess (And additionally if you use the same password for multiple accounts, multiple of your personal accounts can become compromised).

Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.\n", " - A long time ago, when I played a game called ROBLOX, I had some valuable currency that i've saved for some time ($7000). This platform is home to many people who like to phish others out of passwords or other ways to get into accounts. ROBLOX uses a cookie system to store access tokens, so this person convinced me with some ensentaive to place some javascript in my browswer which grabbed the token giving him full access to my account.\n", " Other phishing techniques could be\n", " - Catphishing: Pretending to be someone else to gain information or simply troll others\n", " - Ex: Pretending to be a famous youtuber that will give you a bajillion dollars if you give them your SSN\n", " - Scandals\n", " -Twitter scandals" ] } ], "metadata": { "kernelspec": { "display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3" }, "language_info": { "name": "python", "version": "3.9.6" }, "orig_nbformat": 4, "vscode": { "interpreter": { "hash": "31f2aee4e71d21fbe5cf8b01ff0e069b9275f58929596ceb00d14d90e3e16cd6" } } }, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2 }]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">5.3-4 Hacks</title><link href="https://yuricoder07.github.io/myfiles/week21/2023/02/01/AP-computing_bias.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="5.3-4 Hacks" /><published>2023-02-01T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-02-01T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://yuricoder07.github.io/myfiles/week21/2023/02/01/AP-computing_bias</id><author><name></name></author><category term="week21" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[5.3 Summary What is bias in computing? A computer algorithm or software that unfairly favors one input or population over another is said to have computing bias. This can have happened accidentally or on purpose. The HP facial recognition algorithm, which performs better on those with lighter skin tones, is one illustration of computational prejudice. This is probably due to a lack of experience working with persons who have darker skin tones.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">5.1-5.2 blog</title><link href="https://yuricoder07.github.io/myfiles/markdown/2023/01/30/5.1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="5.1-5.2 blog" /><published>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://yuricoder07.github.io/myfiles/markdown/2023/01/30/5.1</id><author><name></name></author><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[5.1-5.2 lesson blog]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CPT overview</title><link href="https://yuricoder07.github.io/myfiles/markdown/2023/01/30/CPTpersonal.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CPT overview" /><published>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://yuricoder07.github.io/myfiles/markdown/2023/01/30/CPTpersonal</id><author><name></name></author><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[overview of my CPT project]]></summary></entry></feed>
