          <td>Explanation : Correct. The algorithm continues past the first check if the time is during business hours, the algorithm continues past the second check if the gate sensor is activated, and the algorithm continues past the third check if the gate is not open. Performing the checks in this order will ensure that the gate is opened only under the appropriate conditions.</td>

Correct. The given code segment displays “positive” when num is positive, displays “negative” when num is negative, and displays “zero” when num is 0. This code segment produces the same result. When num is negative, “negative” is displayed. Otherwise, when num is 0, “zero” is displayed. Otherwise, “positive” is displayed.</li>

This is an example of a polynomial efficiency and indicates that the algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time. Correct.
