<p>What is bias in computing? A computer algorithm or software that unfairly favors one input or population over another is said to have computing bias. This can have happened accidentally or on purpose. The HP facial recognition algorithm, which performs better on those with lighter skin tones, is one illustration of computational prejudice. This is probably due to a lack of experience working with persons who have darker skin tones.</p>

<p>Not made intentionally, Because it was created using only data from white people, it can only identify white faces. If everyone had access to computers, issues like this may not arise as frequently, which is another argument for closing the digital divide. This has to be fixed because, in addition to excluding black people from something that only white people have (segregation), you are also losing a sizable market segment.</p>

<p>We could develop a platform for coding homework assistance given the high number of computer science students we have. When we are stuck on a particular assignment, we may ask others to email us the relevant sections of their functioning code, post it on the platform, and provide an explanation of the code. We would have the ability to query and be questioned.</p>

<p>Our project could be better with crowdsourcing because our website is based on helping people find recipes and by having many people use our website we are able to store reviewes and be able to reflect on this and renew our website to our best version.</p>

<p>During N@tM, we could ask students, parents, and teachers to use our website. And we can be able to make a review page and show what they disliked and liked. In addition, we can ask users to comment on any ideas to grow our site for next year. They can comment what they liked, what they think we should improve, and ideas for any additions.</p>
